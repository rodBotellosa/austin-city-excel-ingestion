    "content": "Section 25-8-365 (Interbasin Diversion) of the Land Development Code states that development\n            may divert stormwater from one watershed to another if the proposed diversion is less\n            than 20 percent of the gross site area or less than 1 acre, whichever is smaller.\n            The applicant must demonstrate the following:\n\n               \u2022\u2002The existing drainage patterns are maintained to the extent feasible.\n\n                  Minor diversions of drainage between watersheds are permitted to allow for design\n                  flexibility as buildings, parking lots, and other impervious cover are placed along\n                  a watershed divide. The diversion should be the minimum amount necessary to accommodate\n                  the placement of this development along the divide.\n\n               \u2022\u2002There are no adverse environmental or drainage impacts.\n\n                  The applicant must demonstrate no adverse drainage impacts in accordance with 25-7\n                  (Drainage) and the Drainage Criteria Manual.\n\n                  Regulations specific to a watershed classification (e.g., impervious cover limits,\n                  cut and fill requirements, construction on slopes requirements) shall apply to the\n                  watershed boundaries as they exist pre-development. Proposing to change the watershed\n                  boundary with a diversion of stormwater does not change the applicable environmental\n                  regulations, with the exception of water quality treatment. The development shall\n                  provide the level of water quality treatment required for the watershed that the stormwater\n                  drains to post-development.\n\n                  If there are critical environmental features (CEFs) identified on the property and/or\n                  within 150 feet of the property boundaries, staff from the Watershed Protection Department\n                  must determine that the proposed diversions will not adversely impact those features.\n                  Interbasin hydrologic diversion can adversely impact wetland and geologic CEFs if\n                  the diversion either increases or decreases the quantity, quality, or rate of surface\n                  water runoff under which the vegetation, geology, and soils have developed.\n\n                  The hydrophytic vegetation community and soils that characterize a wetland CEF have\n                  adapted over time to a specific range of hydrologic conditions. Reducing flows to\n                  wetlands can effectively collapse the wetland vegetation community and the environmental\n                  services which it provides. Similarly, increasing the rate of runoff of overland flow\n                  which supports a wetland can significantly degrade both the soils and the vegetation\n                  community.\n\n                  The quality, quantity, and rate of overland flow also greatly impacts karst features.\n                  The soils, vegetation community, rock formations, and conduits that have developed\n                  under the historic moisture regime may not be able to perform properly under altered\n                  hydrology. It is imperative to maintain natural patterns and high quality inflows\n                  to recharge features such as sinkholes and caves. Similarly, it is important to ensure\n                  no significant increases to the rate of runoff which may increase erosion or sediment\n                  loading. Bluffs, rimrocks, and springs may also be adversely affected by increases\n                  or decreases to runoff.\n\n            Source: Rule No. R161-14.21, 9-2-2014)",

Guidance for protective measures is in ECM 1.10.0. If no CEFs are present, enter a zero in the space(s) provided. If CEF(s) are present\n            on site or within 150 feet of site boundaries, include the Critical Environmental\n            Feature Worksheet as an attachment to the ERI report. Provide color photographs and\n            detailed description of each CEF(s). The CEF description should supplement information\n            not included in the CEF worksheet such as, presence of wetland and/or spring-indicator\n            plant species, direct or indirect indicators of recharge infiltration at point recharge\n            features, etc. If the standard buffer is not proposed, provide rationale for the proposed\n            alternative buffer.\n            \n            Except for wetland CEFs, if the standard buffer is not provided and/or other variance\n            from LDC 25-8-281 or Title 30-5-281 are proposed, then a written Administrative Variance\n            Request for each CEF must be provided. Administrative Variance Request forms are available\n            in ECM 1.3.3.\n            \n            9.\n            \n            Maps - Provide four maps; a geologic map with two foot topographic contours, a historic\n            aerial photo (greater than or equal to 15 years), a soils map, a CEF and well locations\n            map on the most current (less than 5 years) aerial photo with two foot topographic\n            contours. All maps must show a north arrow, a legend, map scale, the property boundaries\n            and areas within 150 feet of the site. Geologic maps and digital data are available\n            online from the Bureau of Economic Geology STATMAP GIS Database. Soils information\n            and digital soil data files are available at the USDA NRCS web soil survey. Historic\n            and current aerial photography with two-foot contour interval is available at the\n            City of Austin links below.\n            \n            The CEF location map must show all CEFs and wells on site on current aerial photo.\n            For all CEFs show the standard 150 foot buffer; with maximum of 300 foot buffer for\n            point recharge features (see ECM 1.10.0 for buffer guidance). If an alternative buffer\n            or wetland mitigation is proposed, show both the standard buffer and proposed alternative\n            buffer/mitigation. Use shading and/or hatching to differentiate between the two buffer\n            areas.\n            \n            Additional maps may be required, if the following zones are present on site; Edwards\n            Aquifer Recharge Zone, Edwards Aquifer Contributing Zone, 1,500-foot Verification\n            Zone, Water Quality Transition Zone, Critical Water Quality Zone, and City of Austin\n            fully developed floodplain. Maps can show multiple zones provided they are legible.\n            All information required for these maps can be viewed online using the City of Austin's\n            Development Web Map at: http://www.austintexas.gov/GIS/developmentwebmap/\n            \n            or downloaded at: ftp://ftp.ci.austin.tx.us/GIS-Data/Regional/coa_gis.html\n            \n            10.\n            \n            Hydrogeologic Report - Pursuant to LDC 25-8-122 and Title 30-5-122 an ERI must include a hydrogeologic\n            report. The purpose of this component is to provide detailed information on the site\n            geology, soils, and topography to offer insight on the occurrence of CEFs on the site.\n            \n            Surface Soils - Provide a list of the surface soil units present on site. Include the soil series\n            unit name and subgroup (taxonomic classification), the soil hydrologic group and soil\n            thickness. All soils information is provided online by USDA NCRS County Soil Survey\n            Maps. For example:\n            \n            Houston Black, 2 to 8 percent (HoD2), Udic Pellusterts; Group D; 0 to 8.5-feet.\n            \n            Soil series and their taxonomic classification (e.g. Mollisol-Udic Paleustalfs) aid\n            with the identification potential CEF areas. The soils with an Aquic or an Udic moisture\n            regime classification are saturated for all or most of time, and are likely to support\n            wetland plant communities. The ability to transmit or impede water flow is characterized\n            in the County Soil Survey for each soil series with a hydrologic group definition\n            of A, B, C or D in the table of \"Estimated Soil Properties Significant in Engineering.\"\n            The hydrologic group and soil thickness are useful for identifying potential areas\n            of high infiltration or very slow infiltration where point recharge features or wetlands\n            may occur.\n            \n            Provide a description of topography and drainages. The description of the topography\n            facilitates the evaluation of steep slopes, where rimrocks may be present. If point\n            recharge features are present on site, demonstrate that the proposed drainage patterns\n            will protect the quality and quantity of surface water that is draining to a point\n            recharge feature(s) (LDC-25-8-122(3)).\n            \n            Geology - List the group and formation of the surface geologic units.

Based on site observations, determine if the mapped\n            geologic units are present on site. Describe any relationship between the location\n            of CEFs and the geologic units. Example: Several lithologic contacts have a higher\n            propensity for karst development and for the occurrence of contact springs and seeps.\n\n               Wells - Provide the number of wells on or within 150-ft. of the site. If no wells are present,\n               enter \"zero\" in the space provided. Include all oil and water wells, recorded and\n               unrecorded that are active, abandoned, capped, or monitoring. If the site has, or\n               proposes to receive water or wastewater service from the City of Austin, all active\n               water wells must be registered with the City of Austin's Water Utility (see Wastewater\n               Utilities Report). All wells must comply with 16 TAC Chapter 76 and local groundwater\n               district rules; if any. Both inactive and active wells should be reported the local\n               groundwater district. Identify all off site wells by contacting neighboring land owners\n               and research the Texas Water Development Board water well data online.\n\n               11.\n\n               Vegetation Report - Pursuant to LDC 25-8-123 and Title 30-5-123, an ERI must include a vegetation report.\n               The description of the plant communities shall include the description of protected\n               riparian areas on site. Protected riparian areas have minimum canopy extent of \u00bd acre,\n               voids in tree canopy comprise less than 30 percent of the total area, at least 50\n               percent of all trees have diameters of eight inches or greater measured at 4\u00bd feet\n               above ground, and are dominant by a diversity of trees by presence of at least three\n               riparian tree species. Riparian tree species are list in Appendix X and include such\n               trees as post oak, blackjack oak, cedar elm, eastern red cedar, mesquite, pecan, American\n               elm, hackberry, green ash, box elder, and other trees.\n\n               List the dominant woodland, grassland/prairie/savanna, and hydrophytic plant species\n               present on site. Provide both common and scientific names in tables. If a plant community\n               is not present on site, check 'no' and enter n/a in the table.\n\n               12.\n\n               Wastewater Utilities Report - Indicate the type of wastewater treatment proposed for the development by checking\n               the appropriate box. Confirm that the site wastewater collection systems will be constructed\n               to accordance all State, County and City standards [(LDC 25-8-361(D)].\n\n               If applicable, attach the calculation for the sizing of the wastewater drainfield\n               or wastewater irrigation area(s) or indicate appropriate site plan sheet with the\n               calculations.\n\n               Provide environmental justification for the location of wastewater lines within the\n               CWQZ. Discuss alterative alignments or construction methods that were considered or\n               will be used to reduce environmental impacts to CEFs, riparian area, and watercourses\n               (see LDC 25-8-261 and 25-8-361 and follow guidelines in ECM 1.5).\n\n               If over the Edwards Aquifer, describe the wastewater disposal systems proposed for\n               the site, its treatment level and effects on receiving watercourses or the Edwards\n               Aquifer.\n\n               13.\n\n               Provide signature and contact information for person that certifies that, to best of their knowledge, the responses provided\n               are accurate. If the site is over the Edwards recharge zone, the qualified Geologist\n               [as defined in ECM 1.12.3(A)] must seal and sign the report.\n\n               Attach additional information as required, including the Functional Assessment, additional\n               maps, CEF photographs and descriptions, if required.\n\n            Source: Rule No. R161-14.25, 12-30-2014; Rule No. R161-18.05, 6-12-2018.",

    "content": "The purpose of this section is to provide a resource document and policy for the protection\n            of land and water resources, so as to minimize the adverse effects of erosion and\n            sedimentation per the City of Austin's Land Development Code. Additionally, the criteria\n            have been fashioned to complement the language of the Texas Pollution Discharge Elimination\n            System (TPDES) Construction General Permit.\n            \n            The conversion of land from its natural state or agricultural use to urban use accelerates\n            the processes of erosion and sedimentation. These negatively impact the city's drinking\n            water supply, aquatic life and the recreational resource provided by them.\n            \n            Construction related sediment can be a significant pollutant of streams, lakes, ponds\n            and reservoirs. Not only does sediment reduce the quality of water for boating, fishing,\n            swimming and other water-oriented recreation, it also creates maintenance problems\n            due to excessive wear on pumps and due to the reduced capacity of streams, lakes and\n            other waterways. Another problem associated with sediment is the affinity of pesticides,\n            phosphates and many other chemical pollutants for soil particles. These pollutants\n            are carried to the waterway on the sediment and further reduce the quality of the\n            water.\n            \n            Mankind accelerates the erosion process by modifying the topography, soil conditions,\n            vegetative cover and drainage patterns during construction to suit its needs. The\n            clearing and grading of land to convert it from a natural state to cultivated row\n            crops greatly increases the potential for erosion. The magnitude of this increase\n            can be as much as 200 times. In addition, earth moving and construction to convert\n            agricultural land to urban uses such as roads, houses, shopping centers, schools and\n            airports increases the erosion potential another ten (10) times (Erosion and Sedimentation\n            Control Guidelines for Developing Areas in Texas, U.S.D.A., S.C.S., Temple, Texas,\n            1976). After full urbanization takes place in a watershed, however, erosion usually\n            decreases several fold from that experienced during the period of construction (Virginia\n            Erosion and Sedimentation Control Handbook, Second Edition, 1980) and may decrease\n            from that occurring before construction.\n            \n            As additional development and urban growth takes place in Austin, the value of all\n            land and water resources increases. The conservation of these resources is easier\n            and less expensive than their restoration.\n            \n            On most development projects, the major period for erosion potential exists between\n            the time when the existing vegetation is removed to begin site work and the completion\n            of construction and revegetation. There are numerous activities associated with construction\n            and land development that accelerate the rate of erosion. Virtually all of these actions\n            involve the removal of vegetation and/or the movement of the native geologic structure\n            to provide a construction site. The adverse impact upon the site and the environment\n            in general can be reduced if these actions are taken with some thought to the resultant\n            erosion.\n            \n            The control criteria included in this manual provide several methods to address the\n            dual problems of erosion and sedimentation, but are in no way a complete outline of\n            the possible actions to provide adequate reductions. We therefore encourage innovation\n            and suggestions to improve or expand on these concepts. Any questions concerning the\n            criteria or the use of measures not included in the manual should be directed to the\n            Watershed Protection and Development Review Department.\n            \n            The Erosion and Sedimentation Control Criteria are established and reviewed by the\n            Environmental Resource Management Division of the Watershed Protection Department.\n            Development permit review is conducted by the Development Services Department and\n            construction inspection oversight by the Environmental Inspection Section of the Site\n            and Subdivision Inspection Division.\n            \n            Source: Rule No. R161-17.12, 6-13-2017.",

Finally, this policy is the\n            official criteria manual required by the TPDES MS4 permit, and as such strives to\n            comply with all federal and state mandates updating the permit. At this time, neither\n            the NPDES nor the TPDES General Permits require Effluent Limit Guidelines (ELG). However,\n            as of November, 2008, EPA has sent notice that it will impose ELG upon Construction\n            General Permits.

    "content": "Arid Areas - Areas with an average annual rainfall of 0 to 10 inches.\n            \n            Baseflow - The discharge in a channel that is relatively constant, occurring between storm\n            runoff events. That flow which can be expected on a daily basis without storm flows.\n            \n            Best Management Practices (BMPs) - Schedules of activities, prohibitions of practices, maintenance procedures, structural\n            controls, local ordinances, and other management practices to prevent or reduce the\n            discharge of pollutants. BMPs also include treatment requirements, operating procedures,\n            and practices to control construction site runoff, spills or leaks, waste disposal,\n            or drainage from raw material storage areas.\n            \n            Bonded Fiber Matrix (BFM) - Bonded Fiber Matrix shall consist of long thermally refined wood fibers produced\n            from grinding clean, whole wood chips and cross-linked hydro-colloidal tackifiers.\n            \n            Certified Inspector - A person who has received training and is licensed by CPESC, CESSWI or CISEC to\n            inspect and maintain erosion and sediment control practices.\n            \n            Clearing - Any activity that removes the vegetative surface cover. Mass clearing is defined\n            as the practice of clearing the entire site of all vegetation (except protected trees)\n            to prepare for final grading. This is opposed to Selective clearing, which only disturbs\n            the soil and vegetation where a road or infrastructure will be placed.\n            \n            Commencement of Construction - The initial disturbance of soils associated with clearing, grading, or excavation\n            activities, as well as other construction-related activities (e.g., stockpiling of\n            fill material, demolition).\n            \n            Common Plan of Development - A construction activity that is completed in separate stages, separate phases,\n            or in combination with other construction activities. A common plan of development\n            (also known as a \"common plan of development or sale\") is identified by the documentation\n            for the construction project that identifies the scope of the project, and may include\n            plats, blueprints, marketing plans, contracts, building permits, a public notice or\n            hearing, zoning requests, or other similar documentation and activities. A common\n            plan of development does not necessarily include all construction projects within\n            the jurisdiction of a public entity (e.g., a city or university). Construction of\n            roads or buildings in different parts of the jurisdiction would be considered separate\n            \"common plans,\" with only the interconnected parts of a project being considered part\n            of a \"common plan\" (e.g., a building and its associated parking lot and driveways,\n            airport runway and associated taxiways, a building complex, etc.). Where discrete\n            construction projects occur within a larger common plan of development or sale but\n            are located \u00bc mile or more apart, and the area between the projects is not being disturbed,\n            each individual project can be treated as a separate plan of development or sale,\n            provided that any interconnecting road, pipeline or utility project that is part of\n            the same \"common plan\" is not included in the area to be disturbed.\n            \n            Control Plan - indicating the specific measures and sequencing to be used to control sediment\n            and erosion on a development site during and after construction.\n            \n            Discharge - For the purposes of this permit, the drainage, release, or disposal of pollutants\n            in storm water and certain non-storm water from areas where soil disturbing activities\n            (e.g., clearing, grading, excavation, stockpiling of fill material, and demolition),\n            construction materials or equipment storage or maintenance(e.g., fill piles, borrow\n            area, concrete truck washout, fueling), or other industrial storm water directly related\n            to the construction process (e.g., concrete or asphalt batch plants) are located.\n            \n            Drainage Way - Any channel that conveys surface runoff throughout the site.\n            \n            Edwards Aquifer - As defined under Texas Administrative Code \u00a7 213.3 of this title (relating to the\n            Edwards Aquifer), that portion of an arcuate belt of porous, water-bearing, predominantly\n            carbonate rocks known as the Edwards and Associated Limestones in the Balcones Fault\n            Zone trending from west to east to northeast in Kinney, Uvalde, Medina, Bexar, Comal,\n            Hays, Travis, and Williamson Counties; and composed of the Salmon Peak Limestone,\n            McKnight Formation, West Nueces Formation, Devil's River Limestone, Person Formation,\n            Kainer Formation, Edwards Formation, and Georgetown Formation. The permeable aquifer\n            units generally overlie the less-permeable Glen Rose Formation to the south, overlie\n            the less permeable Comanche Peak and Walnut Formations north of the Colorado River,\n            and underlie the less permeable Del Rio Clay regionally.\n            \n            Edwards Aquifer Contributing Zone - The area or watershed where runoff from precipitation flows downgradient to the\n            recharge zone of the Edwards Aquifer. The contributing zone is located upstream (upgradient)\n            and generally north and northwest of the recharge zone for the following counties:\n            all areas within Kinney County, except the area within the watershed draining to Segment\n            2304 of the Rio Grande Basin; all areas within Uvalde, Medina, Bexar, and Comal Counties;\n            all areas within Hays and Travis Counties, except the area within the watersheds draining\n            to the Colorado River above a point 1.3 miles upstream from Tom Miller Dam, Lake Austin\n            at the confluence of Barrow Brook Cove, Segment 1403 of the Colorado River Basin;\n            and all areas within Williamson County, except the area within the watersheds draining\n            to the Lampasas River above the dam at Stillhouse Hollow reservoir, Segment 1216 of\n            the Brazos River Basin. The contributing zone is illustrated on the Edwards Aquifer\n            map viewer at http://www.tceq.state.tx.us/compliance/field_ops/eapp/mapdisclaimer.html\n            \n            Edwards Aquifer Recharge Zone - Generally, that area where the stratigraphic units constituting the Edwards Aquifer\n            crop out, including the outcrops of other geologic formations in proximity to the\n            Edwards Aquifer, where caves, sinkholes, faults, fractures, or other permeable features\n            would create a potential for recharge of surface waters into the Edwards Aquifer.\n            The recharge zone is identified as that area designated as such on official maps located\n            in the offices of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and the Construction\n            General Permit TPDES General Permit TXR150000 The Edwards Aquifer Map Viewer, located\n            at http://www.tceq.state.tx.us/compliance/field_ops/eapp/mapdisclaimer.html\n            \n            can be used to determine where the recharge zone is located.\n            \n            Erosion Control - A measure that prevents erosion.\n            \n            Erosion and Sediment - A set of plans prepared by or under the direction of a certified professional\n            \n            Facility or Activity - For the purpose of this permit, a construction site or construction support activity\n            that is regulated under this general permit, including all contiguous land and fixtures\n            (e.g., ponds and materials stockpiles), structures, or appurtances used at a construction\n            site or industrial site described by this general permit.\n            \n            Fiber Reinforced Matrix (FRM) - Fiber Reinforced Matrix shall consist of long thermally refined wood fibers produced\n            from grinding clean, whole wood chips, crimped interlocking fibers, cross-linked hydro-colloidal\n            tackifiers and performance enhancing additives.\n            \n            Final Stabilization - A construction site status where any of the following conditions are met:\n\n               (a)\n\n               All soil disturbing activities at the site have been completed and a uniform (i.e.,\n               evenly distributed, without large bare areas) perennial vegetative cover with a density\n               of at least 95% of the vegetative cover for the area has been established on all unpaved\n               areas and areas not covered by permanent structures, or equivalent permanent stabilization\n               measures (such as the use of riprap, gabions, or geotextiles) have been employed.\n\n               (b)\n\n               For individual lots in a residential construction site by either:\n\n               (1)\n\n               the homebuilder completing final stabilization as specified in condition (a) above;\n               or\n\n               (2)\n\n               the homebuilder establishing temporary stabilization for an individual lot prior to\n               the time of transfer of the ownership of the home to the buyer and after informing\n               the homeowner of the need for, and benefits of, final stabilization. If temporary\n               stabilization is not feasible, then the homebuilder may fulfill this requirement by\n               retaining perimeter controls or other best management practices, and informing the\n               homeowner of the need for removal of temporary controls and the establishment of final\n               stabilization.\n\n               (c)\n\n               For construction activities on land used for agricultural purposes (e.g. pipelines\n               across crop or range land), final stabilization may be accomplished by returning the\n               disturbed land to its preconstruction agricultural use.

The term ordinary high water mark means \"that line on the shore\n            established by the fluctuations of water and indicated by physical characteristics\n            such as clear, natural line impressed on the bank, shelving, changes in the character\n            of soil, destruction of terrestrial vegetation, the presence of litter and debris,\n            or other appropriate means that consider the characteristics of the surrounding areas\"\n            (Code of Federal Regulations, Title 33, Section 328.3).\n            \n            In the urban watersheds, the Critical Water Quality Zone coincides with the 100-year\n            fully-developed floodplain, bounded by a minimum width of 50 feet and a maximum width\n            of 400 feet measured from each side of the stream centerline.\n            \n            Water Quality Transition Zone\n            \n            The Water Quality Transition Zone is established adjacent and parallel to the outer\n            boundary of the Critical Water Quality Zone and varies by the size of the contributing\n            drainage area as follows:\n\n                              Minor Waterways\n\n                              100 feet\n\n                              Intermediate Waterways\n\n                              200 feet\n\n                              Major Waterways\n\n                              300 feet\n\n               &nbsp;\n\n            The Water Quality Transition Zone only applies to water supply rural watersheds, water\n            supply suburban watersheds, and in the Barton Springs Zone, excluding the shorelines\n            of Lake Austin, Lake Travis, and Lady Bird Lake.\n            \n            C.\n            \n            Exemptions\n            \n            A Critical Water Quality Zone does not apply to:\n\n               \u2022\u2002a previously modified drainage feature constructed primarily to serve a railroad\n               or public roadway right-of-way if staff from the Watershed Protection Department determine\n               that the feature does not possess any natural and traditional character and cannot\n               be reasonably restored to a natural condition;\n\n               \u2022\u2002drainage that is enclosed within a storm drain; or\n\n               \u2022\u2002the area bounded by IH-35, Riverside Drive, Barton Springs Road, Lamar Boulevard,\n               and 15th Street.\n\n            An administrative variance is available under Section 25-8-42 (Administrative Variances)\n            of the Land Development Code for development within the Critical Water Quality Zone\n            in an urban watershed if the proposed development:\n\n               1.\n\n               Consists of redevelopment of an existing footprint within the Critical Water Quality\n               Zone. The existing footprint means the location already disturbed by development within\n               the Critical Water Quality Zone, not an area of equivalent size elsewhere within the\n               Critical Water Quality Zone. The proposed development cannot increase non-compliance\n               with the protections of Article 7, Division 1 (Critical Water Quality Zone Restrictions)\n               of the Land Development Code. In addition, the proposed development cannot be located\n               within 25 feet of the centerline of a waterway or within an erosion hazard zone (unless\n               protective works are provided). If existing development is removed from the Critical\n               Water Quality Zone to comply with these requirements, native vegetation and soils\n               must be restored.\n\n               2.\n\n               Does not increase non-compliance with Section 25-8-281 (Critical Environmental Features)\n               or Section 25-8-282 (Wetland Protection) of the Land Development Code.\n\n            A Water Quality Transition Zone is not applied in urban or suburban watersheds.

Since the area proposed for buffer expansion\n            will be classified as Critical Water Quality Zone, uses allowed within this area would\n            be regulated by Sections 25-8-261 (Critical Water Quality Zone Development) and 25-8-262\n            (Critical Water Quality Zone Street Crossings) of the Land Development Code.\n            \n            If proposing to use buffer averaging on a minor waterway, the applicant will need\n            to perform an Erosion Hazard Zone analysis in accordance with Chapter 25-7 of the\n            Land Development Code and the Drainage Criteria Manual. The area proposed for reduction\n            in width should not be located within the Erosion Hazard Zone.\n            \n            The development application must show the original Critical Water Quality Zone, the\n            areas proposed for reduction, and the areas proposed for expansion. The application\n            should also delineate, where applicable:\n\n               \u2022\u2002the minimum setbacks (50 feet, 100 feet, 150 feet) required for buffer averaging;\n\n               \u2022\u2002critical environmental feature setbacks;\n\n               \u2022\u2002priority or other significant woodlands and prairies identified by the Environmental\n               Resource Inventory; and\n\n               \u2022\u2002the Erosion Hazard Zone delineated for minor waterways.\n\n            In addition, a table should be provided to summarize the reductions and expansions\n            of the Critical Water Quality Zone area as follows:\n\n                              Existing Critical Water Quality Zone\n\n                              _______ acres\n\n                              Areas Proposed for Reduction\n\n                              - _______ acres\n\n                              Areas Proposed for Expansion\n\n                              + _______ acres\n\n                            _____\n\n                              Proposed Critical Water Quality Zone\n\n                              _______ acres\n\n               &nbsp;\n\n            The area calculated in the table for the Proposed Critical Water Quality Zone must\n            be greater than or equal to the area of the Existing Critical Water Quality Zone.\n\n               Example of Buffer Averaging on a Minor Waterway\n\n            Note: The total area of expansion is greater than or equal to the total area of reduction.\n            \n            Source: Rule No. R161-14.22, 9-2-2014; Rule No. R161-18.05, 6-12-2018.",

    "content": "This document provides guidelines for both the design of stormwater controls to enhance\n            water quality and for the long-term maintenance of these facilities. These guidelines\n            should be followed in order to provide protection for the water resources in the Austin\n            area and to minimize time and effort in obtaining project review and approval. It\n            is recognized that not all sites will permit ponds to be designed strictly according\n            to these guidelines and that innovative designs are possible. However, such deviations\n            from these guidelines must be approved by the Watershed Protection Department (WPD)\n            pursuant to LDC Section 25-8-151 (Innovative Management Practices).\n            \n            Stormwater can have significant impact on the water quality of Austin's creeks and\n            the Colorado River. To minimize the effect of non-point source pollutants in stormwater,\n            stormwater control measures (SCMs, or controls) are required to serve development.\n            Controls are designed to improve water quality by removing suspended particulate matter\n            and associated constituents such as bacteria, nutrients and metals.\n            \n            For the purposes of water quality control design, the City of Austin has two water\n            quality zones: the Barton Springs Zone (BSZ), shown in Figure 1.6.1.A, and outside\n            the Barton Springs Zone. Outside the Barton Springs Zone, sedimentation/filtration\n            basin effluent quality is the water quality standard for new development; sedimentation/filtration\n            basins for new development are discussed in detail in Section 1.6.5. If using controls other than sedimentation/filtration basins outside the Barton\n            Springs Zone, site runoff shall have an average annual pollutant load equal to or\n            less than the effluent load of a sedimentation/filtration system that treats the required\n            water quality volume. Inside the Barton Springs Zone, site runoff shall cause no net\n            increase in average annual pollutant load compared to existing conditions per requirements\n            in LDC 25-8 514. Refer to Section 1.6.9 for demonstrating compliance within the Barton Springs Zone. Note that all developments\n            must also comply with State of Texas regulations, such as those applicable to the\n            Edwards Aquifer zone.\n\n               Figure 1.6.1.A: General location map of the Barton Springs Zone\n\n            Applicants are encouraged to contact the WPD staff prior to submitting plans proposing\n            innovative practices. Minimum design guidelines for several alternatives are outlined\n            in Section 1.6.7.\n            \n            Figures 1-46 and 1-47 in Appendix V illustrate water quality design options for suburban\n            and water supply suburban watersheds, and water supply rural watersheds.\n            \n            Source: Rule No. R161-14.26, 12-30-2014.",

Proper maintenance is as important as engineering design\n            and construction in order to ensure that water quality controls, referred to herein\n            as stormwater control measures (SCMs), will function effectively. Section 25-8-231\n            of the Land Development Code requires maintenance be performed on SCMs when necessary\n            as defined by this section.\n            \n            Stormwater control measures required for commercial and multi-family development shall\n            be maintained by the property owner.\n            \n            Stormwater control measures for single-family or duplex residential development shall\n            be maintained by the City of Austin once the facilities have been accepted by the\n            City, unless otherwise determined during the review process. For the City to accept\n            an SCM, the facility must:\n            \n            1.\n            \n            be constructed per the approved development plan;\n            \n            2.\n            \n            meet all applicable requirements of Section 1.6.3 and the Drainage Criteria Manual,\n            \n            Section 1.2.4 E.;\n            \n            3.\n            \n            complete a one-year warranty period, including the completion of all maintenance and\n            rehabilitation activities identified by the Watershed Protection Department; and\n            \n            4.\n            \n            obtain final warranty release approval from the Watershed Protection Department.\n            \n            The City will also maintain SCMs designed to service primarily publicly owned roads\n            and facilities. These SCMs must be designed and built according to the appropriate\n            city standards.\n            \n            B.\n            \n            Maintenance Requirements\u2014Design and Construction.\n            \n            The design of drainage facilities (including but not limited to headwalls, open channels,\n            storm drain, area inlets, and detention, retention and stormwater control measures\n            and their appurtenances) shall comply with the requirements of Section 1.2.4.E of\n            the Drainage Criteria Manual. In addition, SCMs shall comply with the following construction\n            requirements:\n            \n            1.\n            \n            Sediment removed during construction of a detention, retention, or water quality facilities\n            may be disposed of on-site if properly stabilized according to the practices outlined\n            in the erosion and sedimentation control criteria found in Section 1.4.0 of this manual. After the City of Austin has accepted a stormwater facility disposal\n            of sediment must be at an approved landfill.\n            \n            2.\n            \n            During construction of SCMs, temporary erosion and sedimentation controls shall be\n            maintained.\n            \n            3.\n            \n            If runoff is to enter the sand filtration chamber of a water quality control facility\n            prior to completion of site construction and revegetation, inspection and maintenance\n            of all temporary erosion/sedimentation controls are required, as described in the\n            Environmental Criteria Manual Section 1.4.4, to prevent heavy sediment loads caused by home construction from clogging the filtration\n            media.\n            \n            4.\n            \n            In all cases, trees shall be preserved according to the requirements of Section 3 of the Environmental Criteria Manual. The access drive and staging area shall be\n            designed to preserve trees 8\" in diameter and greater to the maximum extent possible.\n            Trees 8\" in diameter and larger shall be surveyed and shown for the proposed access\n            easement at the time of construction plan permitting.\n            \n            5.\n            \n            For filtration systems the design media depth must be verified, accounting for consolidation.\n            If insufficient depth is present, additional media must be added and pre-soaked until\n            the design depth is achieved. Pre-soaking - apply 5\u201410 gallons of water per square\n            foot of media area within one hour.\n            \n            6.\n            \n            Retaining Walls - Retaining walls within SCMs require water-tightness. Water-tightness\n            in retaining walls is essential to the function of the structure. Waterstops shall\n            be provided during construction of expansion joints in retaining walls per Standard\n            Specification 414S, Concrete Retaining Walls.\n            \n            7.\n            \n            Grouted Rock Walls - Grouted rock walls are acceptable only if the design includes\n            an impermeable barrier such as an approved geomembrane liner or reinforced concrete\n            retaining wall. Free standing dry stacked rock walls are not acceptable in any SCM.\n            \n            8.\n            \n            As-Built Surveys - As-built surveys of all flood detention basins and water quality\n            SCMs shall be submitted to the City upon completion of final grade. Surveys shall\n            be conducted by a licensed surveyor or the engineer of record and include representative\n            survey points with elevations taken at top of wall, bottom of wall, center of basin,\n            inlets, outfalls, overflow structures, and side slopes. Additional survey points may\n            be requested at the discretion of the City Inspector to ensure basin integrity. Water\n            quality basins with a drainage area of less than two (2) acres as well as vegetated\n            filter strips do not require submittal of as-built surveys unless deemed necessary\n            by the City Inspector.\n            \n            C.\n            \n            Major Maintenance Requirements.\n            \n            1.\n            \n            The following maintenance activities shall be performed on all SCMs, in addition to\n            the requirements listed for the individual SCM types, to ensure proper function:\n            \n            a)\n            \n            Accumulated paper, trash and debris shall be removed every six (6) months or as necessary\n            to maintain proper operation.\n            \n            b)\n            \n            Structural integrity shall be maintained at all times.

However, when the ponds are built in stable upland\n            areas, the need for maintenance of these ponds should be infrequent. Accumulation\n            of sediment in the basin is the primary reason the pond will require intensive maintenance.\n            Because of this, very careful attention should be paid to adequate, well-maintained\n            erosion and sedimentation controls in the contributing drainage area during construction.\n            This, in combination with the sediment forebay, should prevent the requirement of\n            maintenance of the main pool soon after the pond is put online. The following are\n            guidelines for pond maintenance:\n            \n            During Site Construction - The sediment load to the sediment forebay shall be closely\n            monitored after every storm event. If heavy sediment loads are detected during an\n            inspection, the source should be corrected. Sediment shall be removed from the sediment\n            forebay when one-third of the forebay volume is lost.\n            \n            Upon Completion of Site Revegetation - Any sediment build-up (greater than 5% volume\n            loss) shall be removed from the forebay upon completion of site revegetation. The\n            sediment build-up in the main pool shall be checked and if more the ten-percent of\n            the volume is lost, it should be cleaned at that time.\n            \n            Every Three Months for the First Two Years - During the three month initial inspection\n            cycle, if more than fifteen percent of the volume of the forebay is lost, it shall\n            be cleaned at that time.\n            \n            Every Three Months - Turf areas around the pond should be mowed. Accumulated paper,\n            trash, and debris shall be removed every three months or as necessary. Cattails, cottonwoods,\n            and willows can quickly colonize shallow water and the edge of the pond. These species\n            or any areas of plant overgrowth may be thinned at this time or as needed.\n            \n            Annually - The basin should be inspected annually for side slope erosion and deterioration\n            or damage to the structural elements. Any damage shall be repaired. Large areas, which\n            have dead or missing vegetation, shall be replanted.\n            \n            Every Three Years - The sediment build-up in the sediment forebay shall be checked.\n            The sediment forebay shall be cleaned if more than one-third of the forebay volume\n            is lost.\n            \n            Every Six Years - The sediment build-up in the main pool shall be checked. Sediment\n            shall be removed from the main pool when twenty percent of the main pool volume is\n            lost.\n            \n            5.\n            \n            Retention-Irrigation Systems (Section 1.6.7.A).\n            \n            a.\n            \n            Basins. Structural integrity of basins shall be maintained at all times. Woody vegetation\n            should be controlled/removed to prevent basin leakage. The ability of the basin to\n            retain the water quality volume shall be evaluated by the COA.\n            \n            b.\n            \n            Irrigation Areas. To the greatest extent practicable, irrigation areas are to remain\n            in their natural state. However, vegetation must be maintained in the irrigation area\n            such that it does not impede the spray of water from the irrigation heads. Tree and\n            shrub trimmings and other large debris must be removed from the irrigation area. See\n            requirements in Section 1.6.7.A.3.(g) and (h) regarding requirements for soil and\n            vegetation in irrigation areas.\n            \n            c.\n            \n            Pumps and Irrigation System. The pumps and irrigation system must be inspected or\n            tested a minimum of six (6) times per year to show all components are operating as\n            intended. Two (2) of these six (6) inspections should be after rain events to ensure\n            that the irrigation system and all of its components perform as designed. This includes\n            controls such as weather stations or rain sensors, delays, valves, alarm system, distribution\n            lines, or other components as specified in the system design. Sprinkler heads must\n            be checked to determine if any are broken, clogged, or not spraying properly. All\n            inspection and testing reports must be kept on site and accessible to the City of\n            Austin.\n            \n            d.\n            \n            The overall system shall be inspected for the ability to retain the water quality\n            volume on site per ECM Section 1.6.7.A.\n            \n            6.\n            \n            Vegetative Filter Strips (Section 1.6.7.B).\n            \n            a.\n            \n            Filter strips shall be managed so that a dense, healthy vegetative cover is preserved.\n            \n            b.\n            \n            Unmowed vegetative filter strips are preferred. If mowed the cutting height shall\n            be set to a minimum of four (4) inches for turfgrass and a minimum of 18 inches for\n            bunchgrass. Grass clippings must be removed from the VFS in order to prevent export\n            of nutrients.\n            \n            c.\n            \n            Bare spots and areas of erosion identified during inspections must be replanted and\n            restored to meet specification.\n            \n            d.\n            \n            Accumulated sediment shall be removed.\n            \n            e.\n            \n            Any disturbance to the filter strip as a result of maintenance procedures or other\n            reasons shall be repaired, including re-establishment of the vegetation.\n            \n            f.\n            \n            Corrective maintenance is required if there is evidence of preferential flow paths\n            around or through the VFS (e.g., upstream \"lip\" is silted in or installed too low).\n            \n            g.\n            \n            The level spreaders shall be repaired if damaged or not functioning correctly.\n            \n            7.\n            \n            Biofiltration and Rain Gardens (Sections 1.6.7.C and 1.6.7.H).\n            \n            A.\n            \n            Maintenance Considerations in Design.\n            \n            A lack of maintenance considerations in the design of a landscape commonly results\n            in a site that is more maintenance intensive (i.e., costly) than necessary and/or\n            appropriate for its purpose, and one that requires the routine use of practices that\n            are undesirable (e.g., extensive pesticide use, intensive pruning of plants that grow\n            too large for the spaces they occupy). The designer shall include maintenance considerations\n            and IPM throughout the planning and design phase of a biofiltration project. Landscapes\n            should be designed to allow for the access and aid the maneuverability of maintenance\n            equipment (e.g., if areas of the pond are designed to be mown, acute angles should\n            be avoided in turf areas; wide angles, gentle, sweeping curves, and straight lines\n            are easier to mow).\n            \n            B.\n            \n            Routine Maintenance.\n            \n            Once vegetation is established, biofiltration systems should require less maintenance\n            than sand filtration systems because the vegetation protects the filtration media\n            from surface crusting and sediment clogging. Plant roots also provide a pathway for\n            water to permeate down into the media, thus further enhancing the hydraulic performance\n            of the system. Unless damaged by unusual sediment loads, high flows, or vandalism,\n            the biofiltration media should be left undisturbed and allowed to age naturally, and\n            biofiltration pond vegetation shall be managed so that a dense, healthy vegetative\n            cover is preserved. The following maintenance items should be performed depending\n            on frequency and time of year:\n\n               Biweekly during first growing season: Inspect vegetation until 95% vegetative cover is established.\n\n               Monthly: Check for accumulated sediments, remove as needed.\n\n               Quarterly: Remove debris and accumulated sediment; replace soil media in void areas caused by\n               settlement; repair eroded areas; remulch by hand any void areas.\n\n               Semi-annually: Remove and replace dead or diseased vegetation that is considered beyond treatment\n               (see planting specifications); treat all diseased trees and shrubs mechanically or\n               by hand depending on the insect or disease infestation. If drawdown exceeds the drawdown\n               time according to Section 1.6.3.C.1, lightly scarify soil with hand cultivator; if\n               standing water remains for greater than 96 hours, remove top layer of sediment, mulch,\n               and potentially vegetation; de-compact soil by scarification, and replace mulch and\n               disturbed vegetation.\n\n               Late winter: Trim bunch grasses; mow turf grasses; harvest other types of vegetation according\n               to recommendations in the planting specifications. Adhere to Section 1.6.2.F.\n\n               Spring: Remove previous mulch layer and apply new mulch layer by hand (option) once every\n               two to three years.\n\n            C.\n            \n            Other items.\n            \n            a.\n            \n            Signage shall be used to delineate the boundaries of the biofiltration area that are\n            maintained with minimal mowing, no fertilizers, and limited use of organic herbicides.\n            \n            8.\n            \n            Rainwater Harvesting (Section 1.6.7.D).\n            \n            Proper monitoring and maintenance is important for any system to work appropriately\n            and efficiently. Each configuration will perform differently. After the system has\n            stabilized, inspection and maintenance might be needed several times a year and/or\n            after heavy rainfall events. A pretreatment filter system (i.e., leaf guards, strainers,\n            roof washers, etc.) is required prior to the cistern.\n            \n            Maintenance activities shall be performed according to the following schedule:\n            \n            Post Construction:\n\n               \u2022\u2002The control and repair of erosion rills, from the irrigation system, should take\n               place after each rainfall event until the vegetation is well established.\n\n               \u2022\u2002Adjustments to the irrigation area should be considered as the vegetation matures\n               and/or to minimize erosion problem areas.\n\n            Quarterly or after each rain event:\n\n               \u2022\u2002Inspect water tanks periodically to insure proper functioning. Screen inlet and\n               outlet pipes to keep the system closed to mosquitoes. Cap and lock tanks for safety.\n\n               \u2022\u2002Caps should have access ports for interior inspection and maintenance.\n\n               \u2022\u2002Clean pretreatment filter system, gutters, inflow, and outflow pipes as needed;\n               sediment, trash, leaves, or other debris should not be allowed to accumulate to a\n               point where it impedes the proper function of the rainwater harvesting system.\n\n               \u2022\u2002Irrigation systems should be cleaned and damage sprinkler heads replaced.\n\n            Other items:\n\n               a.\n\n               The requirements for retention/irrigation systems apply when rainwater harvesting\n               is designed to irrigate a vegetated area - see Section 1.6.3.C.4.\n\n               b.\n\n               The requirements for vegetative filter strips apply when a rainwater harvesting is\n               designed to discharge to a vegetated area to be infiltrated - see Section 1.6.3.C.5.\n\n            9.\n            \n            Porous Pavement (Section 1.6.7.E).\n            \n            General Maintenance\n\n               \u2022\u2002Verify that the porous pavement receives no off-site runoff.\n\n               \u2022\u2002Prior to final acceptance it must be demonstrated that the surface saturated hydraulic\n               conductivity of any portion of the porous pavement is at least 20 inches/hour or,\n               if the system is saturated, the entire water quality volume infiltrates into the subgrade\n               within 48 hours.\n\n            Use the following testing methods to verify:\n\n               \u2022\u2002For porous concrete and porous asphalt use ASTM C1701.\n\n               \u2022\u2002For open-jointed block pavement, permeable interlocking concrete pavement (PICP)\n               or concrete grid pavement (CGP) use ASTM C1781.\n\n            Construction and Post construction:\n\n               \u2022\u2002When installing porous concrete, floating and troweling are not used, as those may\n               close the surface pores.\n\n               \u2022\u2002Do not seal or repave with non-porous materials.\n\n               \u2022\u2002No piling of dirt, sand, gravel, or landscape material without covering the pavement\n               first with a durable cover to protect the integrity of the pervious surface.\n\n               \u2022\u2002All landscape cover must be graded to prevent washing and/or floating of such materials\n               onto or through the pervious surface. No off-site flows allowed onto the porous pavement\n               area.\n\n               \u2022\u2002All chemical spills inclusive but not limited to petrochemicals, hydrocarbons, pesticides,\n               and herbicides should be reported to the owner so they can prevent uncontrolled migration.\n\n               \u2022\u2002Chemical migration control may require flushing, and/or the introduction of microbiological\n               organisms to neutralize any impacts to the soil or water.\n\n            Monthly:\n\n               \u2022\u2002Ensure that paving area is clean of debris, ensure that paving dewaters between\n               storms, and ensure that the area is clean of sediments.\n\n            Semi-annually:\n\n               \u2022\u2002Ensure that the porous pavement is protected from clogging due to runoff from landscape\n               areas, rooftops, and other areas that may significantly reduce the long-term permeability\n               by diverting flows away.\n\n            Annually:\n\n               \u2022\u2002To ensure that the entire water quality volume infiltrates into the subgrade within\n               48 hours the pervious surface should be vacuumed to restore the open permeable pores\n               and lift the sediment or other contaminants out that may reduce the long-term permeability.\n\n               \u2022\u2002It is required that this frequency be increased for areas where overhanging vegetation,\n               excessive dirt, and pollutants are frequent.\n\n               \u2022\u2002Inspect the surface for deterioration. As necessary, repair or replace porous pavement\n               or, for open-jointed block pavement or permeable interlocking concrete pavement replenish\n               aggregate within the joints.\n\n            10.\n            \n            Non-Required Vegetation (Section 1.6.7.G).\n            \n            a.\n            \n            An approved Integrated Pest Management Plan with a recorded Restrictive covenant is\n            required. It is extremely important that fertilizer and chemical use be minimized;\n            otherwise the Non-required vegetation may become a source of pollution instead of\n            a treatment best management practice. Tree Pruning and vegetation management should\n            be modified (i.e., less frequent and less intensive) to maximize the leaf surface\n            area, or Leaf Area Index (LAI), the 25-year growth root system, and the rainfall interception\n            rate to increase future benefits.\n            \n            b.\n            \n            As non-required vegetation is to have no off-site runoff and is also required to have\n            porous pavement (or undisturbed natural ground) extended to at least the 25-year growth\n            root system, the porous pavement requirements apply (see 1.6.3.C.8).\n            \n            c.\n            \n            Damage to vegetation must be corrected immediately, with replanting done if necessary.\n            \n            D.\n            \n            Irrigation Guidelines.\n            \n            Irrigation is necessary to establish plants during the first 12-months after installation.\n            Thereafter irrigation needs should be minimal and an irrigation system whether permanent\n            or temporary may not be necessary depending on the weather, type of plants, and extent\n            of plant establishment.\n            \n            Supplemental watering after the first 12-months may be required during periods of\n            extended drought if plant replacement occurred after the first year, for more mesic-type\n            plants, and for trees. Trees typically require two to three years of supplemental\n            water. The necessity for continued irrigation after the first year should be made\n            by a landscape professional.\n            \n            If an irrigation system is proposed, the design shall address both the SCM and plant\n            health needs. In particular, overwatering is unacceptable as it will negatively impact\n            the hydraulic performance and pollutant removal capabilities of SCM.\n            \n            Treated wastewater effluent (also referred to as reclaimed water) contains nutrients\n            at concentrations higher than stormwater runoff. Because these elevated nutrient concentrations\n            would impair the nutrient removal function of SCM, no temporary or permanent irrigation\n            of SCM may occur with reclaimed water or treated wastewater effluent.\n            \n            The following minimum criteria will apply for permanent irrigation systems:\n            \n            1.\n            \n            Soil water moisture sensors shall be installed and connected to the controller at\n            appropriate depths and locations in the biofiltration basin.\n            \n            2.\n            \n            No irrigation during periods when rainfall is occurring.\n            \n            3.\n            \n            Irrigation shall not commence until the soil moisture content of the filtration media\n            is \u2264 25% of the Available Water Capacity (AWC).

    "content": "A.\n            \n            Introduction. Sedimentation/filtration is the primary structural water quality control to reduce\n            non-point source pollution in Urban, Suburban, Water Supply Suburban and Water Supply\n            Rural Watersheds. In the Barton Springs Zone, non-degradation water quality controls\n            are required (Please refer to Section 1.6.9 for design criteria for non-degradation controls). Innovative controls may be acceptable\n            pursuant to Section 25-8-151 of the Land Development Code (Innovative Management Practices).\n            However, these systems must be approved by the Director of the Watershed Protection\n            and Development Review Department (WPDR). The guidelines for several alternative controls\n            are described in Section 1.6.7.\n            \n            B.\n            \n            Criteria for Acceptance of Fee Payment Instead of Structural Controls. The City recognizes that incorporating structural water quality control facilities\n            into some urban watershed land development projects can be difficult. In response\n            to these challenges, Section 25-8-214(C) of the Land Development Code requires the\n            Director to review and accept or deny projects to pay into the Urban Watersheds Structural\n            Control Fund instead of on-site controls. The funds received under this program have\n            and will be used to study, design, implement, and construct urban water quality improvement\n            projects. This program is only for development within an urban watershed as defined\n            by Section 25-8-2 of the Land Development Code.\n            \n            For public mobility projects only: The optional payment instead of structural controls\n            also applies to watersheds outside of Urban as allowed in LDC Section 25-8-214(F).\n            These include Suburban and Water Supply Suburban and Water Supply Rural. LDC 25-8-214(F)\n            requires the Director to review, accept, or deny projects to pay into the Suburban\n            and Water Supply Structural Control Fund using the Appendix U request form. The funds\n            received under this program are intended to be used to study, design, implement, and\n            construct water quality improvement projects in watersheds outside of the Barton Springs\n            Zone that have been impacted by public mobility projects.\n            \n            1.\n            \n            Urban Watersheds Optional Payment instead of Structural Control Fund Acceptance Guidelines\n            \n            a.\n            \n            Categories for Participation.\n            \n            Type I - The City will strongly consider allowing qualifying developments that are\n            classified as Type I to participate in the fee instead of program.

    "content": "A.\n            \n            Full Sedimentation with Filtration. In this system, the sedimentation basin receives the entire water quality volume\n            and detains it for a draw-down time of forty-eight (48) hours. Draw-down time is the\n            time required for the basin to empty from the full water quality volume condition.\n            The effluent from the sedimentation basin is discharged into the filtration basin.\n            Figures 1-51 and 1 52 in Appendix V of this manual illustrate this system. Full sedimentation/filtration\n            or full sedimentation/biofiltration systems shall be required where the City is responsible\n            for maintenance unless topographic constraints make this design unfeasible. Unfeasible\n            is considered: assuming (for the purposes of this selection process only) a maximum\n            ponding depth of three feet in the sedimentation basin, if it is not feasible to obtain\n            an outlet for the drainage from the filtration basin within one hundred (100) feet\n            of the crest of the filtration embankment, then the partial sedimentation/filtration\n            configuration system may be used.\n            \n            1.\n            \n            Basin Surface Areas. A literature review of sedimentation basins (References 76, 77, 82, 84\u201489, 92\u201495,\n            98\u2014100 in the Bibliography) and slow rate filters (References 74 and 85) was conducted\n            in order to establish design criteria.\n            \n            For sedimentation basins, the removal of discrete particles by gravity settling is\n            primarily a function of surface loading, \"Q\n            \n               o\n               \n            /A\n            \n               s\n               \n            \", where \"Q\n            \n               o\n               \n            \" is the rate of outflow from the basin and \"As\" is the basin surface area. Basin\n            depth is of secondary importance as settling is inhibited only when basin depths are\n            too shallow (particle resuspension and turbulence effects). For sedimentation, surface\n            area is the primary design parameter for a fixed minimum draw-down time of forty-eight\n            (48) hours. Removal efficiency is also a function of particle size distribution. For\n            design purposes, the particles selected for complete removal in the sedimentation\n            basin are those which are greater than or equal in size to silt with the following\n            characteristics: particle diameter 0.00007 foot (20 microns) and specific gravity\n            of 2.65. These are typical values for urban runoff (see References 77 and 98).\n            \n            For filtration basins, surface area is the primary design parameter. The required\n            surface area is a function of sand permeability, bed depth, hydraulic head and sediment\n            loading. A filtration rate of 0.0545 gallons per minute per square foot has been selected\n            for design criteria (10.5 feet per day or 3.4 million gallons per acre per day). This\n            filtration rate is based on a Darcy's Law coefficient of permeability of three and\n            one-half (3.5) feet per day, an average hydraulic head of three (3) feet and a sand\n            bed depth of eighteen (18) inches. The Technical Notes at the end of this section\n            include an explanation of how the filtration rate and coefficient of permeability\n            were determined. References 80, 83, 96 and 97 provide additional information.\n            \n            The following equation gives the minimum surface areas required for the sedimentation\n            and filtration basins:\n            \n            The filtration basin surface area is calculated as:\n            \n            A\n            \n               f\n               \n            = WQV/(7 + 2.33*H)\n            \n            where \"A\n            \n               f\n               \n            \" is the minimum surface area of the filtration media in square feet, the inherent\n            drawdown time is 48 hours and \"WQV\" is the water quality volume as defined in Section\n            1.6.2A. in cubic feet, and H is the maximum ponding depth in the filtration basin\n            in feet. The assumed maximum ponding depth of the sand filtration basin should be\n            at least one (1) foot less than the maximum ponding depth in the sedimentation basin,\n            to account for tailwater effects, unless demonstrated otherwise through an engineering\n            analysis.\n            \n            2.\n            \n            Basin Volumes. The storage capacity of the sedimentation basin shall be greater than or equal to\n            the water quality volume. The water quality pond design shall allow enough freeboard\n            above the water quality volume to pass the design flow rate for the one-hundred (100)\n            year storm over the splitter/diversion structure without overtopping of any side walls\n            of the pond, plus an additional five (5) percent of the total fill height or three\n            (3) inches, whichever is greater, to allow for construction irregularities and long\n            term soil settling.\n            \n            If desired, a sediment trap may be included at the bottom of the basin and may be\n            credited with up to five (5) percent of the water quality volume.\n            \n            The storage capacity of the filtration basin, above the surface of the filter media,\n            should be greater than or equal to twenty (20) percent of the water quality volume.\n            This capacity is necessary in order to account for backwater effects resulting from\n            partially clogged filter media.\n            \n            3.\n            \n            Sedimentation Basin Details. The sedimentation basin consists of an inlet structure, flow spreader (if inlet structure\n            does not provide flow spreading), settling area and, outlet structure. The sedimentation\n            basin design should maximize the distance from where the heavier sediment is deposited\n            near the inlet to where the outlet structure is located. This will improve basin performance\n            and reduce maintenance requirements. It is recommended that the bottom of the sedimentation\n            basin (and invert of riser pipe) be \u22652 inches higher than the top of the filtration\n            bed, to prevent excessive tailwater effects that can prolong drawdown times. See Figure\n            1.6.5.A.\n            \n            \u2022\u2002Inlet Structure/Flow Spreader. The inflow of the water quality pond should pass through the splitter structure where\n            the water quality volume is separated (see section 1.6.2B). The water quality volume\n            should be discharged uniformly and at low velocity into the sedimentation basin in\n            order to maintain near quiescent conditions which are necessary for effective treatment.\n            It is desirable for the heavier suspended material to drop out near the front of the\n            basin; thus a drop inlet structure is recommended in order to facilitate sediment\n            removal and maintenance.\n\n               The maximum velocity discharged to the sedimentation basin should not exceed two (2)\n               feet per second. To achieve the required low velocity and to uniformly distribute\n               flow into the sedimentation basin a design such as that shown by Figure 1-48 is recommended.\n               If a design such as that shown in Figure 1-50 is used a flow spreader will likely\n               be necessary at the pipe outfall in order to reduce velocities and distribute flow.\n               For energy dissipation devices do not use City of Austin Standard 508S-13 as this\n               structure does not promote uniform flow into the basin.\n\n            \u2022\u2002Outlet Structure. The outlet structure conveys the water quality volume from the sedimentation basin\n            to the filtration basin. The outlet structure shall be designed to provide for a minimum\n            draw-down time of forty-eight (48) hours. The riser pipe should be made from perforated\n            schedule forty (40) PVC pipe. The draw-down time should be achieved by installing\n            a removable PVC cap with the appropriate sized orifice at the end of the riser pipe\n            (the discharges through the perforations should not be used for draw-down time design\n            purposes). The PVC cap must be accessible for maintenance. The perforated riser pipe\n            should be selected from the following table:\n\n                              TABLE 1-8\n                              \n                              PERFORATED RISER PIPES\n\n                              Riser Pipe Normal Dia. (inches)\n\n                              Vertical Spacing Between Rows (center to center in inches)\n\n                              Number of Perforations per Row\n\n                              Diameter of Perforations (inches)\n\n                              6\n\n                              4\n\n                              4\n\n                              1\n\n                              8\n\n                              4\n\n                              6\n\n                              1\n\n                              10\n\n                              4\n\n                              8\n\n                              1\n\n                              Source: City of Austin\n\n               &nbsp;\n\n               This information is based on commercially available pipe. Equivalent designs are acceptable.\n\n               The top of the riser should extend above the elevation of the splitter weir or should\n               be fitted with a threaded removable cap.\n\n               A trash rack shall be provided for the riser. The trash rack should be made out of\n               galvanized welded wire fabric with a maximum opening size of one (1) inch by one (1)\n               inch and made from twelve (12) gauge wire. The wire joints should be joined using\n               galvanized \"J\" clips. The rack must be removable to facilitate maintenance. The trash\n               rack should be supported by galvanized or rust-proof posts set into a four (4) inch\n               thick reinforced concrete base. The base should be square with the length of each\n               side being three (3) feet plus the diameter of the riser pipe with the riser centered\n               on the base. The height of the trash rack should extend above the maximum water surface\n               elevation or should have a removable galvanized welded wire lid. If the top of the\n               riser pipe is more than three (3) feet high from the base, removable galvanized cross\n               bracing is required for the riser and trash rack. A cone of two (2) to three (3) inch\n               diameter gravel shall be placed around the pipe to enhance settling. The gravel cone\n               must not include any gravel small enough to enter the riser pipe perforations. If\n               the discharge pipe of the riser is to extend through a concrete wall, a sleeve is\n               required in the wall and a water proof sealant should be used to prevent leaks around\n               the sleeve. Figures 1-53 and 1-54 in Appendix V of this manual illustrate these design\n               considerations for risers.\n\n            \u2022\u2002Basin Geometry. See Section 1.6.2.D for acceptable geometry and configuration.\n\n               The sedimentation basin should have a minimum two (2) percent bottom slope to ensure\n               that the pond will drain adequately even after silt accumulation.\n\n               Water collected in the sediment basin shall be conveyed to the filtration basin in\n               order to prevent standing water from occurring. All water collected in the sediment\n               basin shall drain out within ninety six (96) hours. The invert of the drain pipe should\n               be above the surface of the filtration sand bed. The minimum grading of the piping\n               to the filtration basin should be one quarter (\u00bc) inch per foot (two (2) percent slope).\n               Access for cleaning the sediment basin drain system is necessary.\n\n            4.\n            \n            Sand Filtration Basin Details. The sand bed filtration system consists of the inlet structure/flow spreader, sand\n            bed, underdrain piping and basin liner.\n            \n            \u2022 Inlet Structure/Flow Spreader. The inlet structure should spread the flow uniformly\n            across the surface of the filter media. See Figure 1.6.5.A for flow spreader design\n            guidance. A rock flow spreader is recommended. The rocks directly in the flow path\n            of the riser pipe discharge must be sized appropriately to prevent scour and erosion.\n            For proper riprap sizing follow the design criteria located in Section 1.4.6.D, Stone\n            Riprap.\n\n               Figure 1.6.5.A.

The sand bed for city-maintained filtration basins must be built to the\n               \"Sand Bed with Gravel Layer\" configuration below unless topographic constraints make\n               this design unfeasible. Unfeasible is considered: assuming (for the purposes of this\n               selection process only) a maximum ponding depth of three feet in the sedimentation\n               basin, if it is not feasible to obtain an outlet for the drainage from the filtration\n               basin within one hundred (100) feet of the crest of the filtration embankment, then\n               the \"trench design\" may be used. For ponds not maintained by the city, the sand bed\n               may be a choice of one of the two configurations given below.\n\n               Note: Sand bed depths are final, compacted depths. Consolidation effects must be taken\n               into account. Pre-soaking of media is recommended to induce consolidation so that\n               the correct amount of makeup material can be determined. To pre-soak apply 5\u201410 gallons\n               of water per square feet of filtration bed, within 1 hour. The top surface of the\n               sand filter bed must be horizontal, i.e., no grade is allowable.\n\n               1.\n\n               Sand Bed with Gravel Layer (Standard Details 661-1 and 661-2).\n\n               The top layer is to be a minimum of eighteen (18) inches of 0.02\u20140.04 inch diameter\n               sand which corresponds with ASTM C-33 concrete sand (smaller sand size is not acceptable).\n               Under the sand shall be a layer of one-half (0.5) to one and one-half (1.5) inch diameter\n               washed, rounded, river gravel which provides three (3) inches to five (5) inches of\n               cover over the top of the underdrain lateral pipes. Clean, screened, crushed recycled\n               glass no smaller than \u215c inch is also acceptable. The sand and gravel must be separated\n               by a layer of geotextile. The geotextile fabric specifications are shown in Standard\n               Specification 620S, Table 2: High Flow Filter Fabric Requirements.\n\n               2.\n\n               Sand Bed with Trench Design (Standard Details 661-1 and 661-2).\n\n               The top layer shall be twelve (12) to eighteen (18) inches of 0.02\u20140.04 inch diameter\n               sand which corresponds with ASTM C-33 concrete sand (smaller sand size is not acceptable).\n               Laterals shall be placed in trenches with a covering of one-half (0.5) to one and\n               one-half (1.5) inch diameter washed, rounded river gravel which provides three (3)\n               inches to five (5) inches of cover over the top of the underdrain lateral pipes and\n               geotextile fabric. The geotextile fabric is needed to prevent the filter media from\n               infiltrating into the lateral piping. The geotextile fabric specifications are shown\n               in Standard Specification 620S, Table 2: High Flow Filter Fabric Requirements.\n\n               Biofiltration\n\n               Medium Bed (Standard Detail 661-3).\n\n               For Biofiltration Medium specifications refer to Standard Specification 660S, Biofiltration\n               Medium.\n\n               \u2022\u2002Underdrain Piping. The underdrain piping consists of the main collector pipe(s)\n               and perforated lateral branch pipes. The piping should be reinforced to withstand\n               the weight of the overburden. Internal diameters of lateral branch pipes should be\n               six (6) inches or greater and perforations should be three-eighths (\u215c) inch. All piping\n               is to be schedule 40 polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or greater strength. The maximum spacing\n               for the laterals should be ten (10) feet between laterals and five (5) feet from a\n               wall or side. Lesser spacings are acceptable. The maximum spacing between rows of\n               perforations should not exceed six (6) inches.\n\n               The minimum grade of piping shall be one-eighth (\u215b) inch per foot (one (1) percent\n               slope) unless the piping is part of a saturated zone per ECM 1.6.7.H, in which case\n               the minimum grade shall resume at the invert/flowline of the raised outlet pipe. Access\n               for cleaning all underdrain piping is required. Cleanouts with a removable PVC cap\n               are required at the ends of laterals and at every bend outside the water quality SCM\n               (cleanouts outside of SCM shall be set above the water quality elevation). In order\n               to minimize damage to these cleanouts due to maintenance equipment, vandalism, and/or\n               mowing, cleanouts may be permanently capped and set flush or just below the media\n               bed after the 1-year warranty period if no drainage issues are observed. At least\n               one lateral must be accessible for cleaning when the pond is full. The full pond cleanout\n               should extend above the water quality elevation and be located outside of the water\n               quality volume ponding area. In order to minimize vandalism or other types of damage\n               to this full pond cleanout the use of exposed piping shall be avoided or minimized.\n\n               \u2022\u2002Basin Liner. Impermeable liner requirements and specifications are located in Section\n               1.6.2(C).\n\n               \u2022\u2002Outfall. The surface discharge from the underdrain pipe shall be non-erosive. Where\n               feasible the underdrain pipe should discharge to a gravel trench in order to diffuse\n               the flow and promote infiltration and recharge. See Figure 1-52 in Appendix V. If\n               a gravel trench is not feasible other options are shown in the Standard Details 508S-16\n               through 508S-20.\n\n               B.\n\n               Partial Sedimentation/Filtration.\n\n               1.\n\n               Basin Surface Areas and Volume. A filtration rate of 0.0312 gallons per minute per square foot has been selected\n               for design criteria (six (6) feet per day or two (2) million gallons per acre per\n               day). This filtration rate is based on a Darcy's Law coefficient of permeability of\n               two (2) feet per day, an average hydraulic head of three (3) feet and a sand bed depth\n               of 18 inches. This filtration rate is less than that assumed for the filtration basin\n               in the full sedimentation/filtration system due to higher sediment loading and consequent\n               clogging of the filter media. Section A above contains an explanation of how the filtration\n               rate and coefficient of permeability were determined. References 80, 96 and 98 provide\n               additional information.\n\n               Note: The top surface of the sand filter bed must be horizontal, i.e., no grade is\n               allowable.\n\n               The following equation gives the minimum surface area required for the filtration\n               basin:\n\n                  Af = WQV/(4+1.33*H)\n\n               where \"Af\" is the required surface area of the media in square feet and \"WQV\" is the\n               water quality volume in cubic feet as defined in Section 1.6.2A, and H is the maximum\n               ponding depth above the filtration media in feet.\n\n               The combined volume of the sediment chamber and filtration basin exclusive of the\n               gabion volume must be equal to the water quality volume, i.e., Vs + Vf = water quality\n               volume where \"Vs\" is the sediment chamber volume and \"Vf\" is the filtration basin\n               volume.\n\n               The volume of the sediment chamber, \"V\n               \n                  s\n                  \n               \", shall be a minimum of 20 percent of the water quality volume. If a splitter box/diversion\n               structure is required, see Section 1.6.2.B, for minimum design standards.\n\n               2.\n\n               Sediment Chamber Details. The sediment chamber consists of an inlet structure/flow spreader, settling area,\n               and outlet structure. It is recommended that the bottom of the sediment chamber be\n               \u22652 inches higher than the top of the filtration bed. The sediment chamber should have\n               a minimum two (2) percent bottom slope to ensure that the pond will drain adequately\n               even after silt accumulation. A minimum two (2) percent bottom slope is required for\n               ponds where the City is responsible for maintenance.\n\n               \u2022\u2002Inlet Structure/Flow Spreader [see Sections 1.6.2.D and 1.6.5(A)(3) (Inlet Structure)].\n\n               \u2022\u2002Outlet Structure. The outlet structure should be a berm or wall with multiple outlet\n               ports or a gabion so as to discharge the flow evenly to the filtration basin. Rock\n               gabions should be constructed using five (5) to eight (8) inch diameter rocks. The\n               berm/wall/gabion height should not exceed six (6) feet and high flows should be allowed\n               to overtop the structure (weir flow). Multiple outlet ports should be used in the\n               berm/wall so as to induce flow-spreading. The outflow side should incorporate features\n               to prevent gouging of the sand media (e.g., concrete splash pad or riprap).\n\n               3.\n\n               Sand Filtration Basin Details (see Section 1.6.5(A)(4)). See Figure 1-58 for flow diffuser outlet detail. In addition, install a removable\n               PVC cap with an appropriately sized orifice at the end of the underdrain pipe in order\n               to provide a forty-eight (48) hour drawdown time, to account for significant uncertainties\n               to the actual filtration media hydraulic conductivity over the life of the system.\n\n               C.\n\n               Pollutant Effluent Concentration Values for Sand Filtration Systems. For sedimentation/filtration systems designed in accordance with the guidelines in\n               this section, the pollutant effluent concentrations shall be assumed to be equal to\n               the concentrations listed below in Table 1.6.5.C.1. These concentrations shall also\n               be used for load calculations that demonstrate that alternative controls perform equal\n               to or better than sedimentation/filtration systems.\n\n            Table 1.6.5.C.1: Effluent event mean pollutant concentrations for sand filtration\n               systems for Austin, Texas\n            \n            Source: Stormwater Quality Evaluation Section, Watershed Protection Department.

    "content": "The water quality credit system presented in this section sets forth a method for\n            designers to achieve full credit or partial credit for innovative controls that are\n            either undersized or capture runoff from only a portion of the developed site. The\n            objective of the water quality credit system is to provide flexibility for meeting\n            the City's water quality requirements. For example, in many cases full water quality\n            credit can be met through the use of a single control located at the downstream end\n            of the developed site. Alternatively, water quality credit can be achieved through\n            green stormwater quality infrastructure controls distributed throughout a developed\n            site and integrated into the landscape. Water quality credit can also be accrued for\n            the drainage area with Rainwater Harvesting (RWH) systems that capture and beneficially\n            reuse water on-site. The remaining required water quality volume that is not treated\n            with Section 1.6.7 controls must be treated using other controls approved in the Environmental Criteria\n            Manual.\n            \n            The amount of credit for the practices described below can be applied as either a\n            reduction in the size of a water quality control or, in Urban Watersheds, a reduction\n            in the fee-in-lieu cost.\n            \n            The basic credit equation is:\n            \n            WQC = IAF * BMPDF (Equation 1.6.7-1)\n            \n            Where\n\n               \u2022\u2002WQC = Water Quality Credit, a value between 0 and 1, with 1 meaning 100% credit;\n\n               \u2022\u2002IAF = Impervious Area Factor, or the fraction of total impervious area treated by\n               the control; and\n\n               \u2022\u2002BMPDF = Best management practice (BMP) Design Factor, a measure of the degree of\n               design equivalency with sedimentation-filtration systems. Values are on a scale of\n               0 to 1, with 1 meaning 100% credit.\n\n            For two of the practices, porous pavement for pedestrian use and non-required vegetation,\n            the water quality credit is applied as a deduction in the drainage area for sizing\n            water quality controls, as described in the subsections below.\n            \n            For vegetated pond-type controls, which include biofiltration and rain garden controls,\n            the BMPDF factor is based on the following factors:\n\n               WQV\n               \n                  bmp\n                  \n               = water quality capture depth provided by the BMP in inches, and\n\n               WQV\n               \n                  ecm\n                  \n               = ECM required water quality capture depth in inches.\n\n            Specific drawdown time requirements for vegetated pond-type controls are described\n            below in respective subsections for each control. The BMPDF for vegetated pond-type\n            shall be determined using Figure 1.6.7-1 below.\n\n               Figure 1.6.7-1. BMP Design Factor for vegetated pond-type controls.\n\n            For Rainwater Harvesting systems, the BMPDF depends on the type of system, the size\n            of the tank, and how quickly the tank is emptied as described in Section 1.6.7.D.\n            \n            For Vegetative Filter Strips (VFS) the water quality credit is a function of percent\n            infiltration and hydraulic loading rate as described in Section 1.6.7.B.\n            \n            Credit may be restricted or disallowed in some cases for watersheds in the Barton\n            Springs Contributing and Recharge Zones as described below in the subsections for\n            each control.\n            \n            Source: Rule No. R161-24.05, 5-8-2024.",

    "subtitle": "Guidance for Selecting Controls",
    "content": "The following guidance is provided to assist developers and designers with the process\n            of selecting water quality controls. It is applicable to cases where a developer or\n            designer has control over the drainage area above a point where a central or single\n            control facility might otherwise be used. It is not applicable to cases where some\n            parts of a drainage area are controllable and some are not; in that event, each sub-area\n            that is controllable should be assessed according to this guidance.\n            \n            For many sites, water quality requirements can be achieved with a single type of control\n            (for example, a sedimentation/filtration system). However, in some cases stormwater\n            can be managed through a suite of controls that will provide full water quality credit\n            plus added benefits such as reduced runoff volumes, reduction in peak flows, improved\n            site aesthetics and, by distributing control across the watershed, a possible reduction\n            in the need for large, centralized water quality controls at the down gradient end\n            of the site.\n            \n            Figure 1.6.7-2 outlines the recommended hierarchical approach for selecting on-site\n            water quality controls.\n            \n            Source Controls: The first step in the process is to consider opportunities for hydrologic source\n            controls based on the project layout. These controls are designed to reduce or eliminate\n            stormwater runoff at the source by promoting either or both direct infiltration to\n            the subsurface or beneficial reuse. Hydrologic source controls promoting infiltration\n            include Porous Pavement for Pedestrian Use and Non-Required Vegetation. Rainwater\n            Harvesting can also function as a source control promoting beneficial reuse if drawdown\n            of the water quality volume occurs within the required timeframe without discharge\n            to landscape areas during precipitation events (e.g., water is pumped to a separate\n            tank for subsequent beneficial reuse) (Note: infiltration or irrigation from Rainwater\n            Harvesting is addressed below). Hydrologic source controls typically achieve partial\n            water quality credit, consequently reducing the size of downstream controls.\n            \n            Small Scale Distributed Controls: After considering opportunities for reducing runoff at the source, the next step\n            in the water quality control selection process is to consider opportunities for incorporating\n            smaller-scale distributed controls in landscaped areas throughout the site. Distributed\n            controls should be designed to maximize the natural infiltration and storage capacity\n            of the site where feasible. Infiltration is typically not feasible if:\n\n               \u2022\u2002soils are not conducive for infiltration (low permeability),\n\n               \u2022\u2002subsurface water storage capacity is limited due to high groundwater levels or shallow\n               bedrock or impermeable layers,\n\n               \u2022\u2002infiltration would cause or contribute to soil or groundwater contamination, or\n\n               \u2022\u2002infiltration would cause or contribute to geotechnical issues such as slope or foundation\n               stability.\n\n            Distributed controls typically reduce the amount of directly connected impervious\n            area on a site, which will reduce the peak discharge rate by increasing the time of\n            concentration and allow runoff to be managed closer to the source. In addition, distributed\n            controls can also be used to satisfy landscaping requirements described in Section 2 of the ECM. Therefore, both water quality credit and landscape credit can be achieved\n            for the same area. Examples of distributed controls include Vegetated Filter Strips\n            and Rain Gardens. Rainwater Harvesting can also function as a distributed control\n            if the water quality volume is discharged to landscaped areas for infiltration or\n            irrigation. All of these controls can be designed to achieve full or partial water\n            quality credit.\n            \n            Centralized Controls: If it is not feasible to fully capture and treat the required WQV using hydrologic\n            source controls and distributed controls, then centralized treatment facilities should\n            be selected and sized for the remaining WQV. Centralized facilities typically collect\n            runoff from larger drainage areas and are therefore larger in size. Examples of centralized\n            facilities include Retention/Irrigation Systems, Biofiltration Systems, Sedimentation/Filtration\n            Systems, and Wet Ponds.\n\n               Figure 1.6.7-2.

Geotechnical data from previous\n               site studies or nearby representative locations may also be used. If a range of hydraulic\n               conductivity values is available, estimate the infiltration rate as the geometric\n               mean. Porous Pavement for Pedestrian Use may be designed without additional field\n               verification or sampling. Additional field sampling or testing is required for other\n               infiltration-dependent controls.\n\n               B.\n\n               Field Sampling\n\n               The purpose of field sampling is to evaluate the depth and texture of soil at the\n               location of the proposed water quality control. Field sampling activities must be\n               conducted under the direction of a qualified professional. Soil depth and texture\n               within the proposed footprint of the control must be evaluated via test pits, probes,\n               borings, or similar means at a minimum frequency of one test location per 500 square\n               feet. The probe or hole must extend to the minimum soil depth required for the proposed\n               control. For example, the depth to an impermeable layer must be at least 2 feet below\n               the bottom of a rain garden. If the bottom of the proposed rain garden is 1.5 feet\n               below existing ground, the probe or hole must extend a minimum depth of 3.5 feet.\n               Soil samples must be collected and evaluated at a depth below the expected bottom\n               of the infiltration BMP (i.e., in the layer of underlying soil where infiltration\n               will occur). Soil texture of representative samples may be classified in the field\n               or by laboratory methods such as sieve and hydrometer analysis. Based on the soil\n               texture determined in the field, a representative infiltration rate can be estimated\n               from desktop resources (as described above). In the event that soil textures in the\n               field differ from published references, additional testing and analysis must be conducted\n               to establish a representative infiltration rate.\n\n               C.\n\n               In-situ Testing\n\n               More rigorous in-situ infiltration or percolation testing methods provide the most\n               accurate estimate of infiltration rate. A variety of in-situ tests are available for\n               measuring the infiltration capacity of the soil. Laboratory tests are not recommended\n               because typical laboratory samples are less representative of field conditions.\n\n               In-situ testing must be conducted under the direction of a qualified professional.\n               Testing must be conducted within the proposed footprint at a minimum frequency of\n               one test per 2,000 square feet. A higher testing frequency is recommended to more\n               fully characterize the subsurface conditions. When more than one infiltration test\n               is conducted for a single control, a representative infiltration rate may be calculated\n               as the geometric mean of the test results. The infiltration test should be conducted\n               as close as possible to the proposed bottom elevation for the water quality control\n               (i.e., at the bottom of the growing medium layer). Based on observed field conditions,\n               the designer may elect to modify the proposed bottom elevation of the control. Personnel\n               conducting infiltration tests should be prepared to adjust test locations and depths\n               depending on observed conditions.\n\n               The City may require verification testing for infiltration facilities serving greater\n               than one acre of contributing area and where the City believes there may be a risk\n               of infiltration system failure. Site conditions that justify infiltration facility\n               verification testing include but are not limited to: low infiltration capacity soils,\n               history of infiltration failure in the project area, high groundwater levels, indications\n               of soil compaction during construction, new information gained during construction\n               with regards to infiltration facility design and performance (e.g., better soils data,\n               groundwater data, etc.).\n\n               The designer should keep in mind the difference between percolation tests and infiltration\n               tests when determining the design infiltration rate. A measured infiltration rate\n               can be determined from a single or double ring infiltrometer test. However, a percolation\n               rate determined from the simple open pit percolation test is related to the infiltration\n               rate but tends to overestimate infiltration rates due to both downward (vertical)\n               and horizontal movement of water. Infiltration rates correspond only to the downward\n               movement of water.\n\n               An acceptable testing protocol for percolation testing is provided below. Other testing\n               methods that may be used but not discussed in detail in this section include:\n\n               \u2022\u2002Single Ring Infiltrometer Test (ASTM D5126).\n\n               \u2022\u2002Double Ring Infiltrometer Test (ASTM D3385).\n\n               \u2022\u2002Guelph Permeameter.\n\n               \u2022\u2002Constant Head Permeameter (Amoozemeter or USBR Procedure 7300-89).\n\n               \u2022\u2002Other analysis methods at the discretion of the designer and approval of the Director.\n\n               D.\n\n               Percolation Test Protocol\n\n               The percolation test is geared towards investigating smaller infiltration facilities\n               (i.e., facilities with drainage areas 2 acres or less and maximum ponding depths 12\n               inches or less). The test can be conducted using simple tools and manual labor, and\n               does not require extensive excavation.\n\n               1.\n\n               Test Preparation\n\n               \u2022\u2002The test hole opening shall be between 8 and 12 inches in diameter or between 7\n               and 11 inches on each side if square.\n\n               \u2022\u2002The bottom elevation of the test hole shall correspond to the bottom elevation of\n               the proposed control (infiltration surface).\n\n               \u2022\u2002Place approximately 2 inches of gravel in the bottom of the hole to protect the\n               soil from scouring (optional).\n\n               \u2022\u2002If horizontal infiltration is to be allowed, scarify the sides of the test hole.\n\n               \u2022\u2002Pre-soak the hole by carefully filling it with water. If the hole has not drained\n               completely within 24 hours, then an infiltration design is not recommended. Testing\n               may commence after all of the water has percolated or after 15 hours has elapsed since\n               initiating the pre-soak. However, to approximate saturated conditions, testing must\n               commence no later than 26 hours after all pre-soak water has percolated through the\n               test hole.\n\n               \u2022\u2002Place a bar over the top of the hole or a nail near the top of the hole to serve\n               as a datum from which depth measurements will be made.\n\n               \u2022\u2002Measure the depth and diameter of the test hole.\n\n               2.\n\n               Test Procedure\n\n               \u2022\u2002Carefully fill the hole with water to a level greater than or equal to the maximum\n               ponding depth of the rain garden. Measure this water elevation and the time it was\n               taken.\n\n               \u2022\u2002Measure the water surface elevation as it drops, and record the time of each measurement.\n               Measurements shall be taken with a precision of 0.25 inches or better. The number\n               of measurements, and thus time required to conduct the testing, will depend on the\n               infiltration rate of the soil and the time available. As a general recommendation\n               for finer grained soils typically found in Austin, plan to take at least 4 measurements\n               over at least 2 hours. Refill the hole as necessary to extend the test to at least\n               2 hours. The test can be terminated when near steady-state conditions (i.e., when\n               the rate of drop is approximately constant). Alternatively, terminate the test when\n               the test hole is empty (this may require a much longer test period).\n\n               \u2022\u2002Calculate the percolation rate using representative steady-state data points from\n               the latter stages of test where the rate of drop is approximately constant. The percolation\n               rate is the change in water elevation (in inches) by the corresponding time interval\n               (in hours).\n\n               \u2022\u2002Convert the steady-state percolation rate (p) to a representative infiltration rate\n               (i) using the reduction factor (Rf) as follows:\n\n                  i = p/R\n                  \n                     f\n\n                  The reduction factor (R\n                  \n                     f\n                     \n                  ) is given by:\n\n                  R\n                  \n                     f\n                     \n                  = ((2d\n                  \n                     1\n                     \n                  - \u0394d)/D) + 1\n\n                  Where:\n\n                  D\n                  \n                     1\n                     \n                  = water depth at start of representative time interval (in.)\n\n                  \u0394d = water level drop during representative time interval (in.)\n\n                  D = diameter of percolation hole (in.)\n\n                  The reduction factor accounts for water losses through the sides of the percolation\n                  hole. It assumes that the percolation rate is affected by the depth of water in the\n                  hole and that the hole is located in uniform soil. If there are deviations from these\n                  assumptions, then other adjustment may be necessary.\n\n            Source: Rule No. R161-14.26, 12-30-2014; Rule No. R161-16.19, 11-14-16.",

    "content": "1.\n            \n            Introduction. A retention/irrigation water quality treatment system consists of two (2) primary\n            components: (1) a basin which captures and isolates the required volume of stormwater\n            runoff; and (2) a distribution and land application system which generally utilizes\n            pumps, piping and spray irrigation components. The main characteristic of retention/irrigation\n            systems is the ability to retain the entire water quality volume on site and is generally\n            the water quality technology used to meet the SOS non-degradation requirement, Section\n            25-8-514(A). The design should consider factors such as basin impermeability and the\n            irrigation area's ability to infiltrate the water quality volume. Clay liners are\n            not acceptable for retention/irrigation systems where liners are required in the Edwards\n            Aquifer Recharge Zone. For technical requirements of liners, refer to Section 1.6.2. Additionally, refer to the Utilities Criteria Manual, Section 2, for high hazard backflow preventer requirements. When properly designed, this system\n            is effective in removal of pollutants through settling in the retention basin and\n            contact with vegetation, air and soils in the irrigation process, as well as in mitigating\n            stream-bank erosion as required by Section 1.6.8 of the Environmental Criteria Manual. The effectiveness of this BMP at meeting required\n            pollutant removal efficiencies is based upon the following criteria being met.\n            \n            2.\n            \n            Minimum Design Criteria for the Retention Basin. Information on water quality volume, diversion structures, and lining requirements\n            can be found in Section 1.6.2 (General Design Guidelines). In addition, applicable requirements of Section 1.6.3 (Maintenance and Construction Requirements) and Drainage Criteria Manual Section\n            1.2.4 (Drainage System) must be incorporated in the design.\n            \n            a.\n            \n            Retention Basin Volume. The basin must be of sufficient size to capture and hold the required capture volume.\n            Retention basins are designed to capture and hold the water quality volume routed\n            to them via diversion structures. All structural elements &amp; piping below the Water\n            Quality elevation shall be watertight. For development in the Barton Springs Zone,\n            refer to Section 1.6.9.3. of this manual for the required capture volume.\n            \n            b.\n            \n            One-Hundred Year Storm. A bypass capable of conveying the 100-year storm around the basin must be provided.\n            \n            c.\n            \n            Lining. A liner will be required for a retention basin if the basin is located in the Edwards\n            Aquifer recharge zone in accordance with Section 1. The liner must be designed in accordance with Section 1.6.2C (Basin Liners). All\n            retention basins are subject to Section 1.6.3.C.4 (Maintenance and Construction Requirements).\n            \n            d.\n            \n            Erosion Prevention. The inlets to the retention basin must be designed to prevent erosion of the soil\n            and liner. Rock rip-rap or other erosion prevention systems must be placed at the\n            basin inlet to reduce velocities to less than three feet per second.\n            \n            3.\n            \n            Minimum Design Criteria for Wet Well and Pumps.\n            \n            a.\n            \n            Pumps.\n            \n            (1)\n            \n            The retention basin must be emptied within 72-hours after a rain event ends. Emptying\n            of the retention basin must not begin sooner than 12 hours (lag time) after the end\n            of the rainfall event. The flow rate of the pumps (gpm) shall be designed to empty\n            the retention basin in 30 hours or 60 hours (30 hours for single zone and 60 hours\n            for multi-zone irrigation systems).\n            \n            (2)\n            \n            Pumps must be capable of delivering the required volume of water at the necessary\n            rate and pressure to the irrigation system in the designated time period. Pumps and\n            wet well must be sized to minimize the number of on- and off-cycles of the pumps.\n            The rate (Q\n            \n               I\n               \n            ) of inflow from the retention pond Intake Riser (see Section 1.6.7(A)(3)(c)) to the wet well must exceed the pump rate (Q\n            \n               P\n               \n            ).\n            \n            (3)\n            \n            A dual pump system must be provided, with each pump capable of delivering 100 percent\n            of the design capacity.\n            \n            (a)\n            \n            Plug valves must be located outside the wet well on the discharge side of each pump\n            to isolate the pumps for maintenance and for throttling if necessary. Butterfly valves\n            and gate valves must not be used.\n            \n            (b)\n            \n            Check valve(s) must be provided to prevent backflow from the irrigation system back\n            into the pump well.\n            \n            (c)\n            \n            Pumps must be selected to operate within 20% of their best operating efficiency.\n            \n            (4)\n            \n            Pump Operation.\n            \n            (a)\n            \n            The pumps must alternate on start up.

As an alternative, an amp draw (overloads)\n            or other equivalent monitoring device may be used.\n            \n            (5)\n            \n            Float controls or submersible transducers must be provided to control operation of\n            the pumps. Three control settings must be used: (1) one for starting the pump, (2)\n            one for shutting off the pump at the normal low water level, and (3) one for back\n            up shut off of the pump in case the first shut-off fails.\n            \n            (6)\n            \n            An alarm system shall be provided consisting of a red light located at a height of\n            at least five feet above the ground level at the wet well. The alarm shall activate\n            when:\n            \n            (a)\n            \n            The water level is below the primary shutoff float and the pump has not turned off.\n            \n            (b)\n            \n            The high/low-pressure pump shut off switch has been activated.\n            \n            (c)\n            \n            Any other pump failures or system shut down indicated by control panel.\n            \n            The alarm must be vandal proof and weather resistant. If the system is to be privately\n            maintained, a sign must be placed at the wet well clearly displaying the name and\n            phone number of a responsible party that may be contacted if the alarm is activated.\n            \n            (7)\n            \n            A green \"pump run light\" shall be provided which is activated any time a pump is running.\n            The green light should be located directly adjacent to the red alarm light.\n            \n            b.\n            \n            Wet Well.\n            \n            (1)\n            \n            A separate wet well outside of the basin must be provided for the pumps. The wet well\n            must be constructed of precast or cast in place concrete. Complete access to the pumps\n            and other internal components of the wet well for maintenance must be provided through\n            a lockable hatch cover. An isolation plug valve to prevent flow from the retention\n            basin to the wet well during maintenance activities must be provided.\n            \n            (2)\n            \n            Calculations must be provided with the design showing that the wet well will not float\n            under saturated-soil conditions. The top elevation of the well must be higher than\n            the water quality elevation. The wet well, lateral inflow pipe, and pump must be designed\n            to completely evacuate the retention pond. A space of at least two feet must be available\n            below the bottom of the pump intake. The two-foot minimum space below the bottom of\n            the pump may be waived if the applicant demonstrates that adequate filtration of the\n            water quality volume is provided.\n            \n            (3)\n            \n            The pump installation in the wet well and access to the wet well must be designed\n            to allow the pumps to be removed using truck-mounted hydraulic hoist equipment or\n            a portable \"A-frame.\" A system must be provided to allow pump removal without entering\n            the wet well. If rails are used they must be stainless steel.\n            \n            c.\n            \n            Intake Riser. Prior to entering the wet well, stormwater must pass through an appropriate intake\n            riser with a screen to reduce the potential for clogging of distribution pipes and\n            sprinklers by larger debris (e.g. cups, cans, sticks). The intake riser and screen\n            should be designed similarly to Figure 1-54 in the Appendices of this manual. Alternative\n            designs will be considered.\n            \n            4.\n            \n            Minimum Design Criteria for the Irrigation System or Infiltration Field.\n            \n            a.\n            \n            Irrigation Timing.\n            \n            (1)\n            \n            The retention basin must be emptied within 72-hours after a rain event ends.\n            \n            (2)\n            \n            Irrigation must be initiated no sooner than 12 hours after the rain event ceases.\n            \n            (3)\n            \n            The irrigation controller must be set to provide alternating, equivalent irrigation\n            and rest periods until the basin is emptied.\n            \n            (4)\n            \n            The time of irrigation on any area must not exceed the rest time. Continuous application\n            on any area must not exceed two hours.\n            \n            (5)\n            \n            An adjustable rain sensor must be provided which will normally be set to temporarily\n            halt irrigation during rainfalls exceeding one half inch. The rain sensor must be\n            able to interrupt irrigation (stop pumps) in the event of subsequent rain events prior\n            to emptying basin. The 12 hour pump delay may initiate after the rain sensor senses\n            the rain event has terminated.\n            \n            (6)\n            \n            Division of the irrigation area into two or more sections such that irrigation occurs\n            alternately in each section is an acceptable way to meet the requirement for a rest\n            period.\n            \n            b.\n            \n            Irrigation Rate. The infiltration rate at which the soil can accept the irrigated storm water must\n            be derived from the infiltration rate listed in the U.S. Department of Agriculture\n            National Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Soil Survey for the county, location,\n            and soil type verified to be present at the irrigation site. If a range is given,\n            the lower value of the range is to be used. The design irrigation rate is not to exceed\n            0.20 inches per hour even if the lower value of the range exceeds that rate. City\n            of Austin field experience has shown that infiltration rates above 0.20 inches per\n            hour do not function as designed and generate significant nuisance ponding and runoff\n            issues. The application rate may not exceed the infiltration rate on any portion of\n            the irrigation area.\n            \n            c.\n            \n            Irrigation Area or Infiltration Field. Calculations must be provided which demonstrate that an adequate irrigation area\n            or infiltration field will be provided based on the soil infiltration rate, water\n            quality volume, and, for irrigation areas, the application rate and actual irrigation\n            time. The irrigation area or infiltration field system must be included within the\n            water quality easement.\n            \n            d.\n            \n            Irrigation Area Slope. Irrigation must not occur on land with slopes greater than 10%.\n            \n            e.\n            \n            Piping and Valves.\n            \n            (1)\n            \n            All irrigation system distribution and lateral piping (i.e. from the pumps to the\n            spray heads) must be Schedule 40 purple PVC. All pipes and electrical bundles passing\n            beneath driveways or paved areas must be sleeved with PVC Class 200 pipe with solvent\n            welded joints. Sleeve diameter must equal twice that of the pipe or electrical bundle.\n            Buried piping must be marked with detectable marking tape labeled \"CAUTION: BURIED\n            NON-POTABLE WATER LINE BELOW\".\n            \n            (2)\n            \n            Valves. All valves must be designed specifically for sediment bearing water, and be\n            of appropriate design for the intended purpose. All remote control, gate, and quick\n            coupling valves must be located in ten-inch or larger plastic valve boxes with purple\n            caps. All pipes and valves must be marked to indicate that they contain non-potable\n            water. All piping must be buried to protect it from weather and vandalism. The depth\n            and method of burial must be adequate to protect the pipe from vehicular traffic such\n            as maintenance equipment. Velocities in all pipelines should be sufficient to prevent\n            settling of solids. The irrigation design and layout must be integrated with the tree\n            protection plan and presented as part of the Site Plan or Subdivision Construction\n            Plan.\n            \n            (3)\n            \n            Systems must include a plug valve to allow flushing at the end of every line.\n            \n            f.\n            \n            Sprinklers. All sprinkler heads must have full or partial circle rotor pop-up heads and must\n            be capable of delivering the required rate of irrigation over the designated area\n            in a uniform manner. Sprinkler heads should have purple caps to indicate non-potable\n            water. Irrigation must not occur beyond the limits of the designated irrigation area\n            and sprinkler heads should be located at least twice the calculated spray radius from\n            any residential lot. Partial circle sprinkler heads must be used as necessary to prevent\n            irrigation beyond the designated limits. Sprinkler heads must be capable of passing\n            solids that may pass through the intake. Sprinkler heads must be flush mounted and\n            encased within a 2 feet \u00d7 2 feet concrete housing capable of protecting the head from\n            mowing and service equipment (see Appendix V, Figure 1-59F for an example).\n            \n            g.\n            \n            Vegetation. The irrigation area must have native vegetation or be restored or re-established\n            with native vegetation, unless approved by the Director. These areas must not receive\n            any fertilizers, pesticides, or herbicides. If landscaped areas are used for irrigation,\n            fertilizers, pesticides, or herbicides must not be applied to those areas and this\n            limitation must be outlined in the Integrated Pest Management (IPM) plan. For publicly\n            maintained systems, fencing or signs must be installed to limit unauthorized use of\n            the irrigation area. If signs are installed, they must include the phrase \"Stormwater\n            Irrigation Area - No Trespassing.\"\n            \n            h.\n            \n            Soil. The irrigation area must contain a minimum of 12 inches of native or enhanced soil\n            with the appropriate permeability rates. A soils report must be provided and must\n            include at a minimum a soils map verifying soil types in the irrigation area, permeability\n            rates, soil depths, percent of coarse fragments gravel size (2.0 mm diameter) and\n            larger, found on the soil surface and in the subsurface soils, depth of roots, locations\n            of borings or trenches, photographs of exposed soils, location and type of soil enhancement\n            performed, soils testing results, etc. A site visit may be conducted by the city to\n            confirm soil conditions, including when representative trenches have been opened or\n            borings are being conducted. City staff must be given at least 72 hours notice of\n            when borings or trenches are to be backfilled.\n            \n            If soil is enhanced, topsoil or amended topsoil shall meet the requirements of Standard\n            Specification 601S, Salvaging and Placing Topsoil. The condition, type, structure,\n            and quality of the soil shall be conducive to infiltration and to plant growth. If\n            alternative methods of amending soil can be demonstrated to increase the infiltration\n            capacity by at least a factor of three, these methods may be used with approval from\n            the Director of WPD.\n            \n            i.\n            \n            Geological Features.

A buffer area of un-irrigated vegetation must be provided downstream of the irrigation\n            area to treat any runoff that may occur from the irrigation area during heavy rainfall\n            or from excessive irrigation. This area must be a minimum of 50 feet in length (in\n            the direction of flow) and be adjacent to all downstream edges of the irrigation area.\n            As an option, a diversion system (e.g. a swale or berm) may be provided to route any\n            runoff to the retention basin. This diversion system must be designed to carry the\n            runoff from the two-year storm. Alternatively, the irrigation area may be located\n            upstream from the development such that any runoff will be routed to the retention\n            pond.\n            \n            5.\n            \n            Manuals and As-Built Plans.\n            \n            a.\n            \n            The applicant must provide two complete copies of an Operations Manual for the pumps\n            and irrigation system, which must include:\n            \n            (1)\n            \n            Pump curves, electrical schematics, pump and instrument technical information, components\n            of the control panel, pump maintenance recommendations with required frequencies,\n            irrigation controller operation instructions and a written warranty.\n            \n            (2)\n            \n            As-built plans of the retention basin, wet well, pumps, piping and irrigation system.\n            The plans must show the location, size, and type of all pipes, valves, wiring, wiring\n            junctions, and sprinkler heads.\n            \n            For retention-irrigation systems that are to be maintained by the City of Austin,\n            both sets of plans and manuals shall be submitted to the Field Operations Division\n            of the Watershed Protection and Development Review Department.\n            \n            For systems that are to be maintained privately, one set of plans and one manual shall\n            be included with the operating permit application and the second set of plans and\n            one manual shall be retained on site at all times.\n            \n            Source: Rule No. R161-14.26, 12-30-2014; Rule No. R161-16.19, 11-14-2016; Rule No. R161-21.03, 3-9-2021; Rule No. R161-23.17, 8-29-2023.",

    "content": "1.\n            \n            Introduction. Vegetative filter strips (VFS) and disconnection of impervious cover are typically\n            used in areas with relatively low-density development as a passive low maintenance\n            means of protecting nearby receiving waters from marginally increased pollutant loads.\n            They are designed to treat runoff; the procedures described below should not be used\n            when vegetated areas function as a secondary treatment (e.g. vegetated area receiving\n            discharge from a sedimentation filtration basin). Throughout this division, the acronym\n            VFS and the term filter strip is used when referring to vegetative filter strips.\n            For filter strips to work effectively sheet flow shall be maintained and maximum hydraulic\n            loading rates (see Design Requirements) in the filter strip shall not be exceeded.\n            This requirement will limit the size and/or impervious cover that is practical for\n            treatment. Vegetated areas that are designed to pond runoff are not considered to\n            be vegetative filter strips and will require different design procedures (not described\n            here). The VFS shall be restricted from development or any use that may negatively\n            affect the function of the VFS (e.g., intensive recreational uses, pet use, etc.).\n            This can be accomplished through the dedication of an easement or dedicated conservation\n            lot for single family construction plans and, for site plans, by clearly labeling\n            the VFS area by shading or cross hatching on the site plan sheet(s). In either case,\n            the site plan must contain provisions to physically restrict access to the easement\n            or conservation lot (e.g., fences, bollards, signage). An approved Integrated Pest\n            Management Plan with a recorded Restrictive covenant is required. It is extremely\n            important that the VFS not be over-irrigated and that fertilizer and chemical use\n            be minimized; otherwise the VFS may become a source of pollution instead of a treatment\n            best management practice (BMP).\n            \n            2.\n            \n            General Design Guidelines. Filter strips must be sized correctly, have the proper slope, utilize sheet flow,\n            have appropriate soil type and thickness, and have appropriate vegetation of the proper\n            density. Filter strips are typically designed by grading the site to promote overland\n            flow of runoff to a vegetated area. Level spreaders are required at the upstream end\n            of the filter strip if the length of the contributing drainage area (in the direction\n            of flow) exceeds 72 feet. The maximum length of the contributing drainage area shall\n            not exceed 150 feet. Level spreaders or other measures for preventing flow from becoming\n            concentrated should be spaced throughout the length of the filter strip at intervals\n            of no more than 25 feet. For rooftop impervious cover disconnects the downspouts must\n            be at least 10 feet away from the nearest impervious surface to discourage \"re-connections\".\n            The VFS shall not receive runoff until after the contributing drainage area has been\n            stabilized to prevent erosion and sedimentation.\n            \n            Filter strips can be classified as either natural or engineered. In general, natural\n            filter strips utilize existing vegetated areas whereas engineered filter strips are\n            constructed features. Engineered vegetative filter strips differ from natural vegetative\n            filters in that they are specifically designed and constructed to maximize the water\n            quality benefits of this practice, particularly in areas where adequate buffers do\n            not exist naturally or cannot be preserved. Filter strips should have a minimum slope\n            of 1%. Engineered filter strips should be constructed to maintain a constant slope\n            that does not exceed 10%. Where existing vegetated areas are to be used (\"natural\"\n            VFS) the average slope of the VFS should not exceed 10%, with no portion exceeding\n            15%.\n            \n            It should also be noted that vegetative filter strips cannot be used to provide detention\n            of erosive flow (2-year control per Section 1.6.8) or flood flows. Additionally, vegetative filter strips are not recommended for use\n            within the Barton Springs Zone.\n            \n            3.\n            \n            Design Requirements for Full Water Quality Credit. The width (perpendicular to direction of flow) of the VFS should be at least as wide\n            as the contributing drainage area. The hydraulic loading rate (HLR) applied to the\n            VFS for the two-year, three-hour rainfall event shall not exceed 0.05 cfs/ft width,\n            calculated as the peak flow rate divided by the VFS width.\n            \n            The length (dimension in direction of flow) of the vegetative filter shall be at least\n            25 feet.\n            \n            To receive full water quality credit, vegetative filter strips shall be sized to achieve\n            at least 65% infiltration over the length of the filter strip. The required filter\n            strip area per contributing area to achieve 65% infiltration shall be determined using\n            Figure 1.6.7.B-1 below.\n\n               Figure1.6.7.B-1: Minimum sizing criteria for vegetative filter strips to achieve full\n                  water quality credit (i.e., 65% infiltration).\n\n               4.\n\n               Design Requirements For Partial Water Quality Credit. Partial water quality credit is provided for filter strips that do not meet the size\n               and HLR requirements for full credit. The BMP design factor (BMPDF) is one factor\n               that is used to calculate the partial water quality credit (see Equation 1.6.7-1).\n               For filter strips, the BMPDF is calculated as:\n\n               If the HLR for the peak flowrate for the 2-year, 3-hour rainfall event is \u22640.05 cfs/ft\n               width:\n\n                  BMPDF = I\n                  \n                     VFS\n                     \n                  /I\n                  \n                     65\n                     \n                  (Equation B-1)\n\n               If the HLR for the peak flowrate for the 2-year, 3-hour rainfall event is &gt;0.05 cfs/ft\n               width and \u22640.15 cfs/ft width:\n\n                  BMPDF = (I\n                  \n                     VFS\n                     \n                  /I\n                  \n                     65\n                     \n                  ) \u00d7 (HLR\n                  \n                     0.05\n                     \n                  /HLR\n                  \n                     VFS\n                     \n                  ) (Equation B-2)\n\n                  Where:\n\n                  I\n                  \n                     VFS\n                     \n                  = infiltration provided by the proposed filter strip (%),\n\n                  I\n                  \n                     65\n                     \n                  = 65% infiltration criterion for full credit,\n\n                  HLR\n                  \n                     VFS\n                     \n                  = the HLR of the proposed vegetative filter strip (cfs/ft width), and\n\n                  HLR\n                  \n                     0.05\n                     \n                  = 0.05 cfs/ft width HLR criterion for full credit.\n\n               Infiltration provided by the proposed filter strip shall be determined using Figure\n               1.6.7.B-2 below. A maximum value of 1 is allowed for the BMPDF factor, even if the\n               proposed VFS provides more infiltration than 65% or if the HLR is lower than 0.05\n               cfs/ft width. Additional credit is not provided for filter strips sized larger than\n               1.5 times the contributing drainage area. For lower permeability soils (Type D or\n               Type C), the soil can be amended to achieve greater infiltration rates. Soil amendment\n               criteria are outlined in the Landscape Elements section below.\n\n               Figure 1.6.7.B-2: For partial water quality credit, use this chart to determine percent\n                  infiltration based on the size of the filter strip, size of contributing drainage\n                  area, contributing area impervious cover, and soil type.\n\n               5.\n\n               Level Spreaders. For filter strips that require level spreaders, the following design guidance is\n               provided. To ensure that runoff enters the VFS instead of flowing around it, the elevation\n               of the leading edge of the VFS should be three (3) to six (6) inches lower than the\n               elevation at which flow is discharged from the level spreader. To limit any erosion\n               that could occur as water falls from the top of the level spreader to the filter strip,\n               a layer of filter fabric should be extended a distance of 3 feet from the level spreader\n               lip towards the filter strip. Stone, such as ASTM No. 57 aggregate, should be placed\n               on top of the filter fabric (3 to 4 inches deep) to reduce erosion just downslope\n               of the level spreader. A 3-foot wide strip of erosion control matting can be used\n               in place of the filter fabric and ASTM No. 57 aggregate combination. However, such\n               an area must be stable and have adequate vegetation before receiving stormwater. See\n               Figure 1.6.7.B-3, Recommended Level Spreader Details for Vegetative Filter Strip.\n               For additional guidance on level spreader design see:\n\n               http://h2o.enr.state.nc.us/su/documents/LevelSpreaderGuidance_Final_-3.pdf. (note, however, that this North Carolina document is not a substitute for City of\n               Austin criteria).\n\n               Figure 1.6.7.B-3: Recommended Level Spreader Details for Vegetative Filter Strip.\n\n               6.\n\n               Landscape Elements. Vegetative filter strips shall have a minimum overall soil depth of twelve (12) inches,\n               with at least 6 inches of topsoil at the surface and at least 6 inches of native or\n               fill soil below it. Topsoil or amended topsoil (see Figures 1.6.7.B.1 and 1.6.7.B.2\n               above) must meet the requirements of Standard Specification 601S, Salvaging and Placing\n               Topsoil. If alternative methods of amending soil (such as mechanical aeration with\n               sand medium backfill) can be demonstrated to increase the infiltration capacity by\n               at least a factor of 3, these methods may be used with approval from the Director.\n\n               The condition, type, structure and quality of the soil shall be conducive to infiltration\n               and to plant growth. Soil, if compacted, must be loosened. Compact soils are defined\n               as those having a reading of greater than 300 psi at a depth of three inches (using\n               a soil compaction penetrometer). Non-compacted soils, or loosened soils, shall have\n               a reading of less than 300 psi.\n\n               Decompaction shall be completed in two phases: (1) the existing subsoil shall be aggressively\n               fractured (ripped) to the required depth and (2) topsoil shall be added to the subsoil,\n               and the topsoil shall be tilled simultaneously with the existing subsoil to ensure\n               proper mixing and prevent partial recompaction.\n\n               The filter strip should have dense vegetative cover (minimum 95% coverage as measured\n               at the base of the vegetation). Suitable vegetation for VFS includes grasses, forbs,\n               shrubs and trees. The use of native grasses is strongly recommended due to their resource\n               efficiency and their ability to enhance soil infiltration. In the case of natural\n               wooded areas where 95% vegetative cover is not present, a minimum of four inches of\n               leaf litter, mulch or other organic matter must be in place. In these areas, lower\n               tree limbs should be removed, the canopy opened and the area seeded with appropriate\n               grasses and forbs in order to enhance ground cover.\n\n               Turfgrasses shall be a minimum of three (3) inches in height and bunchgrasses a minimum\n               of eighteen (18) inches in height.\n\n               Existing vegetation can be used as filter strips if all other design criteria are\n               met. An appropriate selection of plants will vary with site conditions and the user\n               is referred to growgreen.org for guidance regarding appropriate plants and their use.\n               The VFS should not include invasive and pest species (e.g., Johnson Grass). To establish\n               a dense and healthy vegetative cover, temporary irrigation and limited fertilization\n               may be required.\n\n               7.\n\n               Maintenance Requirements. See Section 1.6.3.\n\n               8.\n\n               Example.\n\n               A 5-acre commercial site with 50% impervious cover (2.5 impervious acres) is required\n               to provide on-site water quality treatment. It is proposed to route 1 acre of parking\n               lot (100% impervious cover) to a 0.8-acre vegetative filter strip (VFS), with dimensions\n               350 feet wide by 100 feet long. The proposed VFS area has type C soils and the soils\n               will not be amended. Without the VFS the water quality volume required is 0.8\u2033, or\n               14,520 ft\n               \n                  3\n                  \n               . What water quality credit can be applied to this site?\n\n               As the parking lot area to be treated is 1 acre, and the total site impervious cover\n               is 2.5 acres, the Impervious Area Factor (IAF, see Equation 1.6.7-1) is 1/2.5 = 0.4.\n\n               For determining the BMPDF value, refer to Figure 1.6.7.B.2. The proposed VFS is 0.8-acre.\n               The ratio of VFS area to contributing drainage area is 0.8-acre per 1 acre, or 0.8.\n               For 100% impervious cover and type C soil, the corresponding percent infiltration\n               is 55%. Next calculate the peak flow rate for the 2-year, 3-hour rainfall event, then\n               determine if the proposed HLR is less than or equal to 0.05 cfs/ft. width. In this\n               case this criterion is met, thus from Equation B-1:\n\n               BMPDF = 55/65 = 0.85\n\n               Inserting the values into the water quality credit Equation 1.6.7-1:\n\n               WQC = IAF * BMPDF = 0.4 * 0.85 = 0.34\n\n               The vegetative filter strip reduces the required WQV by 4,937 ft\n               \n                  3\n                  \n               , or to 9,583 ft\n               \n                  3\n                  \n               .\n\n            Source: Rule No. R161-14.26, 12-30-2014.",

    "content": "1.\n            \n            Introduction. Rooftops can generate large volumes of runoff which, when discharged\n            to paved surfaces and landscaped areas, can generate large pollutant loads. Rainwater\n            Harvesting (RWH) systems can capture this runoff before it is discharged, thus preventing\n            pollution while also putting the captured water to beneficial use, such as landscape\n            irrigation, toilet flushing, or cooling water. In acknowledgement of the pollutant\n            load removal provided by RWH, commercial developments that comply with and implement\n            RWH as required by Chapter 15-13 shall be allowed a stormwater quality \"credit\" which\n            would allow developers to reduce the size of their water quality ponds by a specified\n            amount in the drainage area where the RWH system is located. The amount of runoff\n            captured over the long-term, and thus the allowed stormwater credit will depend on\n            the volume of the cistern and rate at which the cistern empties.\n            \n            There are two types of RWH systems for the purposes of determining water quality credit.\n            Type I systems generally are designed for stormwater control with ancillary potable\n            water offset benefit. Type II systems are designed primarily for potable water offset\n            with ancillary stormwater control. Both systems will be permitted for commercial developments\n            and multifamily residential developments.\n            \n            For the purposes of calculating water quality credit, the RWH system types are defined\n            as follows:\n            \n            A.\n            \n            Type I - a RWH system in which the collection cistern has a maximum drawdown time of 120 hours.\n            These can be either gravity drained (Type IA) or pumped (Type IB) to an infiltration\n            area. These systems are prohibited from having a potable water supply connection.\n            \n            B.\n            \n            Type II - a RWH system in which the collection cistern empties as stored water is used to meet\n            onsite demand. Type II systems are designed and permitted in accordance with Chapter\n            15-13 of the Code of Ordinances (Onsite Water Reuse) and will have potable back up\n            water to supply demands when there is no rainwater available. For the purpose of calculating\n            the stormwater credit, Type II RWH systems are further defined as follows:\n            \n            \u2022\u2002Type IIA - a Type II system with a 1-inch capture depth and is located outside the Barton Springs\n            Zone. This type allows a streamlined water quality crediting approach.\n            \n            \u2022\u2002Type IIB - a Type II system with a custom-sized collection cistern and/or is located inside\n            the Barton Springs Zone. This type requires site-specific engineering analysis to\n            obtain water quality credit.\n            \n            Type I and Type II systems can also control the peak flow rate for the 2-year storm.\n            See Section 1.6.8 if specifically designed for this purpose. Type I RWH systems can provide equivalent\n            treatment to a standard sedimentation/filtration system and may be used within the\n            Barton Springs Zone if the design achieves the non-degradation load requirements detailed\n            in Section 1.6.9. Type I and Type II RWH systems will only be permitted for commercial developments.\n            All systems with pumps (whether Type I or Type II systems) are subject to cross-connection\n            testing in accordance with Chapters 15-1 (Cross Connection Regulations) and 25-12\n            (Technical Codes).\n            \n            2.\n            \n            Water Quality Credit.\n            \n            The water quality credit will typically be applied as either a reduction in the water\n            quality volume for a structural control or a reduction in the payment in-lieu.

BMP Design Factor for Type I Rainwater Harvesting Systems.\n\n               The derivation of the drawdown time will vary with the type of system, as described\n               below for specific design options. In all cases the drawdown is calculated as:\n\n               DDT = WQV/Q\n               \n                  rwh\n\n               Where:\n\n                  \u2022\u2002DDT is the drawdown time, or time for full control to empty, including any lag time\n                  (hours).\n\n                  \u2022\u2002WQV is the water quality volume.\n\n                  \u2022\u2002Q\n                  \n                     rwh\n                     \n                  is the rate of discharge from the rainwater harvesting system.\n\n               B.\n\n               Water Quality Credit for Type II rainwater harvesting systems.\n\n               For Type II RWH systems, the approach for determining BMPDF is based on the Net Annual\n               Reuse Demand Intensity (NARDI). The NARDI is a ratio of the net annual demand to the\n               available rainwater storage capacity and is calculated as:\n\n               NARDI = (D\n               \n                  npr\n                  \n               - S\n               \n                  acc\n                  \n               ) / V\n               \n                  rwh\n\n               Where:\n\n               \u2022 D\n               \n                  npr\n                  \n               is the annual non-potable reuse demand in gallons,\n\n               \u2022 S\n               \n                  acc\n                  \n               is the annual air conditioning condensate supply in gallons, and\n\n               \u2022 V\n               \n                  rwh\n                  \n               is the volume of the rainwater harvesting system tank in gallons.\n\n               Values for D\n               \n                  npr\n                  \n               and S\n               \n                  acc\n                  \n               shall be determined using Austin Water's Water Balance Calculator, which is available\n               at Austin Water's Onsite Water Reuse web page (https://www.austintexas.gov/department/onsite-water-reuse-systems). The BMPDF for Type IIA systems can be determined using Figure 1.6.7.D-2 or the\n               equation below:\n\n               Figure 1.6.7.D-2. BMP Design Factor for Type IIA Rainwater Harvesting Systems.\n\n               For Type IIA systems, the BMPDF is calculated as:\n\n               BMPDF = max(0.1, min(0.5, 0.1429 ln(NARDI) - 0.2221))\n\n               The equation above yields a BMPDF ranging between a minimum value of 0.1 and a maximum\n               value of 0.5. The BMPDF is based on a Type IIA RWH. Systems designed to meet the minimum\n               requirements of LDC Section 25-9-414 are considered Type IIA.\n\n               For Type IIB RWH systems, applicants must provide a site-specific engineering analysis.\n               The site-specific engineering analysis shall demonstrate that average annual pollutant\n               loads from the proposed developed site with the proposed Type IIB system do not exceed\n               the average annual pollutant loads produced by the site under baseline conditions\n               (as defined below). Applicants are encouraged to contact Watershed Protection Department\n               and Austin Water Onsite Water Reuse staff prior to submitting plans proposing Type\n               IIB systems. The site-specific engineering analysis shall meet the following requirements:\n\n               \u2022 SWMM software - The analysis shall be based on long-term continuous simulation calculations\n               using the Environmental Protection Agency's Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) Version\n               5.2 or later and should follow COA's SWMM Guidance Manual which is available from\n               the Watershed Protection Department. SWMM is a Windows-based desktop program. It is\n               open-source public software and is free for use worldwide.\n\n               \u2022 Rainfall record - SWMM calculations shall incorporate a long-term continuous 13-year,\n               15-minute rainfall record (2006-2018) from the Lady Bird Lake gauge. The rainfall\n               record is available from Austin Watershed Protection Department.\n\n               \u2022 Pollutant concentrations - Pollutant concentrations in runoff, SCM effluent, and\n               SCM bypass shall be based on those listed in ECM Section 1.6.9. The pollutant loading analysis shall be based on total suspended solids, total phosphorus,\n               and zinc. Pollutant concentrations in AC condensate shall be assumed to be zero. Pollutant\n               concentrations in RWH system bypass shall be equal to those entering RWH systems.\n\n               \u2022 Baseline conditions scenario (see Figure 1.6.7.D-3) - SWMM shall be used to calculate\n               average annual pollutant loads for the site for baseline conditions. For sites outside\n               the Barton Springs Zone, the baseline scenario shall calculate annual pollutant load\n               for the developed site including a sedimentation-filtration system sized with the\n               standard half-inch plus WQV. For sites inside the Barton Springs Zone, the baseline\n               scenario shall calculate pollutant loads for the existing site conditions in accordance\n               with the Save Our Springs Ordinance.\n\n               Figure 1.6.7.D-3. Model Network for Sedimentation-FiltrationBaseline Scenarios.\n\n               \u2022\u2002Proposed conditions scenario (see Figure 1.6.7.D-4) - SWMM shall be used to calculate\n               average annual pollutant loads for the site under proposed developed conditions. Proposed\n               conditions shall include the Ordinance-mandated RWH system with the proposed RWH cistern.\n               Overflow from the RWH system and runoff from the remainder of the developed site shall\n               be routed to one or more stormwater control measure(s). The RWH system and other proposed\n               SCMs shall be designed and sized to demonstrate that average annual pollutant loads\n               for the site do not exceed the average annual pollutant loads for baseline conditions.\n               The analysis shall account for reuse demands on a daily basis at rates and frequencies\n               to match proposed conditions. For example, reuse rates for indoor commercial uses\n               shall be applied five days per week if weekend demands are expected to be significantly\n               less than weekday demands. Similarly, reuse rates for landscape irrigation shall be\n               applied one or two days per week to match the expected irrigation frequency.\n\n            Figure 1.6.7.D-4. Model Network for Beneficial Reuse Scenarios.\n\n               3.\n\n               Design Options.\n\n               A typical configuration for a Type I RWH system is shown in Figure 1.6.7.D-5. To receive\n               water quality credit, rainwater harvesting systems must be designed so that captured\n               runoff is held for at least 12 hours after rainfall has ceased, then either gravity-drained\n               to a vegetated area sized large enough to infiltrate all the water (Design Guidance\n               for Type IA) or pumped to a vegetated area (Design Guidance for Type IB). The latter\n               design is similar to a retention/irrigation system and Section 1.6.7(A) should be referenced for guidance. The vegetated area can also serve as a vegetated\n               filter strip for flows that by-pass the rainwater harvesting system.\n\n               Because the required drawdown time is no more than five (5) days, these systems generally\n               cannot be used to meet water conservation-oriented landscape irrigation needs (e.g.,\n               5-day watering schedule). However, the portion of the system capacity that is recovered\n               during the 5-day (maximum) drawdown period may be eligible for water quality credit.\n               For example, water in the system may be pumped to a separate tank for subsequent beneficial\n               reuse such as landscape irrigation during dry conditions.\n\n               Figure 1.6.7.D-5. Typical configuration for a rainwaterharvesting system.\n\n               Alternatively, and with approval from the Director, the system may be designed to\n               empty or partially empty prior to the next forecasted rain event using an advanced\n               real-time controller.\n\n               The water quality volume must be provided by the system designer, with the drawdown\n               time set to a maximum of 120 hours. The designer must demonstrate that the vegetated\n               area is sufficiently large to infiltrate the entire water quality volume within 120\n               hours (see Figure 1.6.7.D-3 below).\n\n               The average \"treatment\" rate of the rainwater harvesting system is:\n\n               Q\n               \n                  avg\n                  \n               = WQV/DDT\n\n               Where:\n\n                  \u2022\u2002Q\n                  \n                     avg\n                     \n                  is the treatment rate,\n\n                  \u2022\u2002WQV is the water quality volume, and\n\n                  \u2022\u2002DDT is the drawdown time, which is set to a maximum of 120 hours.\n\n               It is reasonable to assume saturated conditions, and the infiltration rate of the\n               vegetated area can be calculated as:\n\n               Q\n               \n                  veg\n                  \n               = k * i * A\n\n               Where:\n\n                  \u2022\u2002k = soil hydraulic conductivity,\n\n                  \u2022\u2002i = hydraulic gradient, and\n\n                  \u2022\u2002A = infiltration (vegetated) area.\n\n               Figure 1.6.7.D-6. Type IA RWH System with captured runoff discharged to a vegetated\n                  area for infiltration.\n\n               As minimal ponding of water over the vegetated area is expected, the hydraulic gradient\n               can be assumed equal to 1, thus:\n\n               Q\n               \n                  veg\n                  \n               = k * A\n\n               To be conservative, design the vegetated area for the maximum flowrate discharged\n               from the rainwater harvesting system. A reasonable assumption is to assume a value\n               twice Q\n               \n                  avg\n                  \n               , and to also assume a lag time (LT) between the time runoff ends and when the rainwater\n               harvesting system begins discharging:\n\n               Q\n               \n                  p\n                  \n               = (2 * WQV)/(DDT - LT)\n\n               Setting the peak flow rate discharged from the rainwater harvesting system equal to\n               the vegetated area infiltration rate, and solving for A:\n\n               A = (2 * WQV)/(k * (DDT - LT)\n\n               Where:\n\n                  \u2022\u2002A = minimum required infiltration (vegetated) area in ft\n                  \n                     2\n                     \n                  ,\n\n                  \u2022\u2002WQV = water quality volume in ft\n                  \n                     3\n                     \n                  ,\n\n                  \u2022\u2002K = hydraulic conductivity in ft/hour,\n\n                  \u2022\u2002DDT = drawdown time in hours,\n\n                  \u2022\u2002LT = lag time in hours.\n\n               A design infiltration rate (i.e., hydraulic conductivity) for the site must be established\n               through desktop study and field sampling as described in Section 1.6.7.4. The lag time LT should be set to a minimum of 12 hours.\n\n               To be eligible for water quality credit the vegetated area also must meet the following\n               criteria:\n\n               \u2022\u2002The length (dimension in direction of flow) of the vegetative area should be at\n               least 15 feet.\n\n               \u2022\u2002The average slope of the vegetative area must be between 1% and 10%, with no portion\n               exceeding 15%.\n\n               \u2022\u2002The hydraulic loading rate should not exceed 0.05 cfs per feet width for the maximum\n               flowrate applied to the vegetated area (see below for procedure to calculate peak\n               flowrate). Higher hydraulic loading rates are allowed but will reduce water quality\n               credit. In this case, a maximum allowable rate of 0.15 cfs per feet width is allowed.\n\n               \u2022\u2002The soil depth should be a minimum of twelve (12) inches.\n\n               \u2022\u2002The vegetated area should have dense vegetative cover (minimum 95% coverage as measured\n               at the base of the vegetation). The use of native grasses is strongly recommended\n               due to their resource efficiency and their ability to enhance soil infiltration. In\n               the case of natural wooded areas where 95% vegetative cover is not present, a minimum\n               of four inches of leaf litter or mulch must be in place.\n\n               \u2022\u2002An irrigation plan is required. Type IA RWH systems are prohibited from having a\n               potable water supply connection.\n\n            Design Guidance for Type IB RWH System - Captured Runoff Pumped to Vegetated Irrigation\n               Area\n\n               A typical design configuration in which captured runoff is pumped to irrigate a vegetated\n               area is shown in Figure 1.6.7.D-7 below. The water quality volume must be provided\n               by the system designer, with the drawdown time set to a maximum of 120 hours. The\n               system should be designed according to the retention/irrigation criteria in Section\n               1.6.7.A.\n\n               Rainwater systems are considered auxiliary water sources by the Austin Water Utility.\n               When a rainwater harvesting system meets the definition of Auxiliary Water per the\n               City of Austin - Utility Criteria Manual (UCM) then the design of this system must\n               comply with the backflow protection requirements established in Section 2.3.4 of the\n               UCM, Backflow Prevention Rules and Regulations Pertaining to Sites With Both City\n               Potable Water and Auxiliary Water.\n\n               Figure 1.6.7.D-7. Type IB RWH system with captured runoff used to irrigate a vegetated\n                  area.\n\n            Design Guidance for Type II Rainwater Harvesting Systems\n\n               Type II RWH systems (both A and B) must be designed in accordance with requirements\n               set forth in Chapter 15-13 - Regulation of Onsite Water Reuse Systems of the City\n               of Austin Code of Ordinances. Some developments may be required to install Type II\n               systems per LDC Section 25-9-412 (Onsite Water Reuse System Requirement). In addition,\n               Type II RWH systems are subject to in Chapters 15-1 (Cross Connection Regulations)\n               and 25-12 (Technical Codes).\n\n               4.\n\n               Example.\n\n               A 5 acre commercial development with 50% impervious cover (2.5 impervious acres) is\n               proposing a rainwater harvesting system that would capture runoff from 1 acre of rooftop\n               and drain it by gravity to a vegetated area (Option A). The development is located\n               outside of the Barton Springs Zone. The system would have a water quality volume of\n               25,000 gallons, which would be emptied in 96 hours by discharging to a vegetated area\n               that is 260\u2032 wide by 90\u2032 long. The design hydraulic conductivity for the site was\n               established to be 0.06 in/hour, or 0.005 ft/hour. Evaluate this design and determine\n               the water quality credit it may be eligible for.\n\n               The water quality credit will typically be applied as either a reduction in the water\n               quality volume of a structural control or a reduction in the payment instead of structural\n               controls.\n\n               As the alternative control is for 1 acres of impervious cover, and the site has a\n               total of 2.5 impervious acres, the IAF value is 0.40 (=1/2.5).\n\n               \u2022\u2002The BMPDF factor is a function of two components, the rainwater harvesting system\n               and the vegetated area. The BMPDF value for the rainwater harvesting system is based\n               on the water quality volume and drawdown time, subject to the requirement that the\n               vegetated area must be large enough to infiltrate the captured volume.\n\n               To determine the BMPDF value, first convert the water quality volume from gallons\n               to inches:\n\n               WQV\n               \n                  rwh\n                  \n               = (25,000 gallons * 1 ft\n               \n                  3\n                  \n               /7.481gal) = 3,342 ft\n               \n                  3\n                  \n               = 0.92-inch\n\n               The BMPDF value is a function of the following factors:\n\n                  WQV\n                  \n                     rwh\n                     \n                  /WQV\n                  \n                     ecm\n                     \n                  and\n\n                  DDT\n                  \n                     rwh\n\n               The rainwater harvesting system will be capturing runoff from a rooftop that is 100%\n               impervious cover. The water quality capture depth for 100% impervious cover is 1.30-inch\n               for projects located outside of the Barton Springs Zone. Therefore, the factors to\n               determine BMPDF are:\n\n                  WQV\n                  \n                     rwh\n                     \n                  /WQV\n                  \n                     ecm\n                     \n                  = 0.92/1.3 = 0.71, and\n\n                  DDT\n                  \n                     rwh\n                     \n                  = 96 hours.\n\n               Inserting these values into Figure 1.6.7.D-1, gives:\n\n                  BMPDF = 0.68.\n\n               Before this credit can be applied first determine if the vegetated area is sufficient\n               to infiltrate the water quality volume in 96 hours.\n\n               Is it large enough?\n\n               Minimum size A = (2 * WQV)/(k * (DDT - LT)) = (2 * 3,342)/(0.005 * (96-12) = 15,914\n               ft\n               \n                  2\n                  \n               .\n\n               Size provided = 260\u2032 * 90\u2032 = 23,400 ft\n               \n                  2\n                  \n               - this is large enough.\n\n               Is the length of the vegetated area at least 15 feet?\n\n               Yes as the proposed length is 90 feet.\n\n               Does it meet the 0.05 cfs/ft. width hydraulic loading rate for the discharge from\n                  the rainwater harvesting system?\n\n               To estimate peak flowrate and hydraulic loading rate:\n\n               Q\n               \n                  p\n                  \n               = (2 * WQV)/(DDT - LT) = (2 * 3,342)/(96 - 12) = 80 cfh = 0.022 cfs\n\n               HLR = Q/W = 0.022/260 = 0.00008 cfs/ft width - Okay as &lt; 0.05\n\n               All other slope, soil depth, vegetative cover, etc. criteria is also met, thus the\n               vegetated area is acceptable and:\n\n               The total water quality credit for the proposed system is:\n\n               WQC = IAF * BMPDF = 0.4 * 0.68 = 0.272\n\n               5.\n\n               References:\n\n               1.\n\n               The Texas Manual on Rainwater Harvesting, 3rd edition 2005.\n\n               2.\n\n               City of Tucson Water Harvesting Guidance Manual, October 2005.\n\n               3.\n\n               City of Austin Energy, Green Building Program, 1995.\n\n            Source: Rule No. R161-14.26, 12-30-2014; Rule No. R161-23.17, 8-29-2023; Rule No. R161-24.05, 5-8-2024.",

    "content": "1.\n            \n            Description. Porous pavement describes a system comprising a limited capacity load-bearing, durable\n            surface together with an underlying layered structure that temporarily stores water\n            prior to infiltration and releases the temporarily stored water by infiltration into\n            the underlying permeable subgrade.\n            \n            Porous pavement can qualify for Water Quality credit if designed using the storage\n            within the underlying structure or sub-base to infiltrate stormwater and provide ground\n            water recharge to reduce pollutants in stormwater runoff. When proposing the use of\n            a porous pavement system highly detailed specifications and details must be provided\n            and an experienced contractor shall be selected, to minimize potential problems.\n            \n            A.\n            \n            The types of porous pavement systems that are acceptable for both pedestrian and vehicular\n            traffic are as follows:\n            \n            1.\n            \n            Open-jointed block pavement, permeable interlocking concrete pavement (PICP) or concrete\n            grid pavement (CGP): These systems consist of high strength concrete units that are\n            separated by open or stone-filled joints that allow stormwater to infiltrate. The\n            concrete units are laid on an open graded, single-sized granular base. See Figure\n            1.6.7.E-1 for a typical cross section.\n            \n            2.\n            \n            Porous asphalt (PA): This system consists of regular bituminous asphalt in which the\n            fines have been screened and reduced, creating void spaces and making it permeable.\n            See Figure 1.6.7.E-2 for a typical cross section. Permeable friction course (PFC)\n            is a porous asphalt overlay placed over an impervious cover surface and is not eligible\n            for water quality credit.\n            \n            B.\n            \n            The type of porous pavement system that is acceptable for pedestrian use only is as\n            follows:\n            \n            1.\n            \n            Porous concrete pavement: This system is monolithically poured concrete produced by\n            binding aggregate particles with a mortar created with water and cement as specified\n            by the manufacturer. Minimal sand content results in large voids and high pavement\n            porosity, typically between 15 and 25%. This high porosity and the weaker cement bond\n            result in less strength compared to conventional concrete. See Figure 1.6.7.E-3 for\n            a typical cross section.\n            \n            2.\n            \n            Site Selection.\n            \n            Land Use - Porous pavement should be limited to pedestrian areas, areas with low vehicular\n            traffic volumes, smaller axle loads and low speeds such as, parking stalls, smaller\n            parking lots, overflow parking areas of larger parking lots and other areas with little\n            or no traffic. Permeable surfaces are currently not considered suitable for roads\n            with heavy traffic or high speeds due to the risks associated with failure, the safety\n            implications of ponding, and disruption arising from reconstruction.\n            \n            Off Site Flows - Run-on from drainage area(s) outside of the porous pavement area\n            is not allowed.\n            \n            Hot Spots - Porous pavement systems depend upon infiltration into the underlying permeable\n            subgrade. Due to the potential for groundwater contamination, porous pavement shall\n            not be allowed under stormwater hot spots or in areas where land use or activities\n            generate highly contaminated runoff or yield high sediment loads. Hot spot runoff\n            frequently contains pollutant concentrations exceeding those typically observed in\n            stormwater. Hot spots include, but are not limited to, commercial nurseries, auto\n            salvage facilities, hazardous materials generators (where containers are exposed to\n            rainfall), vehicle fueling and maintenance areas, and vehicle and equipment washing\n            dry or steam cleaning facilities, food production/distribution loading dock and trash\n            compactor areas (Note: Some of these land uses/activities may have additional discharge\n            restrictions under City Code Chapter 6-5, Article 5, Discharges into Storm Drains\n            or Watercourses).\n            \n            Barton Spring Zone - Porous pavement is not acceptable as a water quality control\n            and will not receive credit against water quality volume calculations.\n            \n            Geotechnical Evaluation - A major factor for most design decisions is related to the\n            existing soil conditions. It shall be necessary to obtain geotechnical/soils and subsurface\n            information prior to the design of a porous pavement system. To demonstrate the feasibility\n            of the design the following information must be submitted to the Planning and Development\n            Review Department engineer with the site plan or subdivision construction permit application:\n            \n            1.\n            \n            Soil Conditions - The subgrade saturated hydraulic conductivity must be greater than\n            or equal to 0.20 in/hr.\n            \n            o\u2002For sites with a consistent soil type, a minimum of one soil permeability test must\n            be taken per 5,000 square feet of planned porous surface area. The determination of\n            the infiltration rate must follow the criteria established in Section 1.6.7.4, Infiltration Rate Evaluation.\n            \n            o\u2002Testing must be performed prior to the start of construction and prior to the placement\n            of the base or gravel layer on the native soil to verify that design saturated hydraulic\n            conductivity values are present. The Environmental inspector must be contacted 48\n            hours prior to these tests being performed so they can be present during the test\n            and/or evaluate and approve the results.\n            \n            2.\n            \n            Water Table - The depth to water table is greater than or equal to twelve (12) inches.\n            \n            3.\n            \n            Bedrock - The depth to bedrock is greater than or equal to twelve (12) inches.\n            \n            Setback Requirement - If a porous pavement system is proposed near a structure or\n            a street. Then an additional geotechnical evaluation shall be undertaken to identify\n            potential impacts and to establish minimum distances between the system and the structure.\n            \n            Impermeable Barrier - Porous pavement adjacent to buildings, roadways, and other structures\n            may require the installation of an impermeable barrier to prevent possible damage\n            to these structures due to infiltration. The requirement for impermeable barriers\n            may be at the discretion of the design engineer. The Public Works Director or designated\n            representative shall review any decisions on impermeable barrier(s) within City ROW\n            and easements.\n            \n            Slopes - The use of porous pavement system shall be restricted to gentle slopes up\n            to a 20 to 1 grade (5%). On steeper slopes the potential for water seepage out of\n            the pavement surface limits effectiveness.\n            \n            3.\n            \n            Design Guidelines. The designer must select the appropriate material properties, the appropriate pavement\n            thickness, underlying layers, material types, and other characteristics needed to\n            meet the anticipated traffic loads and hydrological requirements simultaneously.\n            \n            For water quality credit purposes, a porous pavement area that meets the criteria\n            can be deducted from the drainage area used for sizing the water quality control;\n            however it is not eligible for impervious cover credit unless allowed under City Code\n            Section 25-8-63 (e.g. multi-use trails, fire lanes, etc.).\n            \n            The following criteria must be met when designing a porous pavement system:\n            \n            A.\n            \n            The gravel layer below porous pavement must have a minimum thickness greater than\n            or equal to five (5) inches with an assumed effective porosity no greater than 0.30\n            to account for reduced volume due to sediment. The gravel layer must be an open graded\n            (single size) aggregate, with little or no fines. Examples of standard open graded\n            gravel materials that allow for storage and conveyance of storm water are those that\n            meet C-33 ASTM Nos. 8, 9, 57, and 67.\n            \n            B.\n            \n            For open-jointed block pavement, PICP, or CGP:\n            \n            \u2022\u2002It is required that the joints be filled with a durable, angular, porous, open-graded,\n            aggregate that promotes rapid infiltration, and meeting C-33 ASTM No. 8 or 9 aggregate\n            requirements.\n            \n            \u2022\u2002In order to preserve the porosity and permeability of the pavement fine-graded sands\n            or aggregates, such as concrete sand, soil and mortar sand, are not allowed.\n            \n            C.\n            \n            For porous concrete design and construction the design engineer must follow the recommendations\n            provide by The American Concrete Institute (ACI) committee 522.\n\n               Figure 1.6.7-E.1 Typical cross section for Open-jointed block pavement, Permeable\n                  Interlocking Concrete Pavement or Concrete Grid Pavement.\n\n               Figure 1.6.7.E-2 Typical cross-section for Porous Asphalt.\n\n               Figure 1.6.7.E-3 Typical Cross Section for porous concrete pavement.\n\n               4.\n\n               Site Plan or Subdivision Construction Plan Requirements. The following information must be included in the Site or Subdivision Construction\n               plan sheet(s):\n\n               A.\n\n               The standard sequence of construction must be modified to include the following special\n               requirements:\n\n               1.\n\n               Pre-Construction - Contractor installation qualifications require that the contractor\n               provide to the Environmental Inspector at the preliminary construction meeting a statement\n               attesting to qualifications and demonstrating experience. Contractors must prove specialized\n               competence by presenting a copy of current certification from an authoritative porous\n               pavement industry association.\n\n               Acceptable porous pavement industry associations are the following:\n\n               \u2022\u2002For open-jointed block pavement, permeable interlocking concrete pavement, or concrete\n               grid pavement: Interlocking Concrete Pavement Institute, Brick Industry Association,\n               National Concrete Masonry Association,\n\n               \u2022\u2002For porous asphalt: Texas or National Asphalt Pavement Associations,\n\n               \u2022\u2002For porous concrete pavement: Texas or National Ready Mixed Concrete Associations,\n               or\n\n               \u2022\u2002American Society of Civil Engineers.\n\n               2.\n\n               Saturated hydraulic conductivity testing must take place twice:\n\n               a.\n\n               Prior to construction, and\n\n               b.\n\n               Prior to placement of the gravel bed.\n\n               3.\n\n               The Environmental inspector must be contacted 48 hours prior to the placement of the\n               gravel bed saturated hydraulic conductivity test being performed and test results\n               must be provided to the inspector documenting that the design saturated hydraulic\n               conductivity has been met.\n\n               B.\n\n               The construction and post-construction/inspection notes below (Sections 1.6.7.E. 5\n               &amp; 6) must be included on the stormwater control measure plan sheet.\n\n               5.\n\n               Construction. Proper construction of permeable pavement systems requires measures to preserve natural\n               infiltration rates prior to placement of the pavement, as well as measures to protect\n               the system from the time that pavement construction is complete to the end of site\n               construction. The following recommendations apply to all permeable pavement systems:\n\n               A.\n\n               General.\n\n               1.\n\n               Keep mud and sediment-laden runoff away from the pavement area.\n\n               2.\n\n               Temporarily divert runoff or install sediment control measures as necessary to reduce\n               the amount of sediment run-on to the pavement.\n\n               3.\n\n               Cover surfaces with a heavy impermeable membrane when construction activities threaten\n               to deposit sediment onto the pavement area.\n\n               4.\n\n               Low ground pressure (LGP) track equipment should be used within the pavement area\n               to limit over-compacting the subgrade. Wheel loads such as, passenger cars and pick-up\n               trucks should not be allowed on the pavement area during construction.\n\n               B.\n\n               Subgrade Preparation. Since porous pavement is an infiltration practice it is imperative\n               that the permeability of the underlying native soils be preserved. The following recommendations\n               apply to all permeable pavement systems:\n\n               1.\n\n               It is important to protect the subgrade from over compaction, accumulation of fines,\n               excessive construction equipment traffic, and surface ponding. Any accumulation of\n               debris, fines, or sediment that has occurred during subgrade preparation should be\n               removed prior to starting the gravel bed installation.\n\n               2.\n\n               Grading shall not take place during wet soil conditions to minimize sealing of the\n               soil surface.\n\n               3.\n\n               In situations where the subgrade has been over compacted or the permeability has been\n               diminished scarification should take place to a depth sufficient to match the naturally\n               occurring in-situ state. Typically scarification should be a minimum of four (4) to\n               six (6) inches in depth.\n\n               C.\n\n               Gravel Bed Preparation. The gravel bed should consist of clean, crushed gravel, free\n               of mud, clay, vegetation or other debris, conforming to ASTM C 33 for stone quality.\n               Size gradation shall conform to ASTM C-33 No. 57 or No. 67 as described in City of\n               Austin Standard Specification 510.2.(a), Pipe Bedding Stone.\n\n               Placement of the gravel bed can occur once:\n\n               1.\n\n               The design saturated hydraulic conductivity of the subgrade has been verified using\n               the criteria stated in Section 1.6.7.4.\n\n               2.\n\n               The City of Austin Environmental inspector has approved the gravel bed preparation.\n\n               3.\n\n               Any accumulation of debris, fines, or sediment that has occurred during the placement\n               of the gravel bed installation has been removed.\n\n               D.\n\n               Porous Pavement Installation. Contractor installation qualifications require that\n               the contractor provide to the City of Austin Environmental inspector, at the preliminary\n               construction meeting, a statement attesting to qualifications and demonstrating experience\n               with the following porous pavement procedures and tests:\n\n               For all types of porous pavement systems:\n\n               1.\n\n               Contractors must prove specialized competence by presenting current certification\n               from an authoritative industry association. (See Section 1.6.7.E.4.A.1 for examples\n               of acceptable industry associations.)\n\n               2.\n\n               Provide the addresses for a minimum of three (3) completed projects with similar geologic\n               and climate conditions as the proposed site.\n\n               For porous concrete and porous asphalt systems provide additional information regarding\n               the procedures that will be followed to meet the following:\n\n               \u2022\u2002Measuring unit weight acceptance data.\n\n               \u2022\u2002Conducting in-situ pavement tests including void content and unit weight.\n\n               \u2022\u2002Preparing product samples.\n\n               If the installing contractor and pavement producer do not have sufficient experience\n               with porous pavement systems, the installing contractor shall retain an experienced\n               consultant to monitor production, handling, and placement operations at the contractor's\n               expense.\n\n               6.\n\n               Post Construction/Inspection. The porous pavement surface saturated hydraulic conductivity must be greater than\n               or equal to 20 in/hr.\n\n               Use the following testing methods to verify the surface saturated hydraulic conductivity:\n\n                  \u2022\u2002For porous concrete and porous asphalt use ASTM C1701.\n\n                  \u2022\u2002For open-jointed block pavement, PICP, or CGP use ASTM C1781.\n\n               All inspection, infiltration testing, and maintenance activities shall be documented\n               and made available to City of Austin inspection staff upon request.\n\n               7.\n\n               Flood Mitigation.\n\n               For porous pavement systems complying with the flood detention requirements of the\n               Drainage Criteria Manual the following criteria will apply:\n\n                  \u2022\u2002Monitoring ports will be required.\n\n                  \u2022\u2002Must provide an annual 3\n                  \n                     rd\n                     \n                  party inspection as required for Subsurface Ponds (see Section 1.6.2.E).\n\n                  \u2022\u2002The storage volume must be increased to account for losses due to sediment build\n                  up. Since no run on is allowed on the porous pavement system a minimal increase in\n                  volume of fifteen percent (15%) is required.\n\n               8.\n\n               Maintenance. See Section 1.6.3.C.8 for requirements related to maintenance.\n\n               9.\n\n               Example. A 5-acre commercial site with 50% impervious cover (2.5 impervious acres) is required\n               to implement on-site water quality controls. The development proposes to use 0.5 acres\n               (of the 2.5 impervious acres) of porous asphalt for parking spaces. Determine the\n               water quality credit for this system.\n\n               Without the porous pavement, the water quality volume required is 0.80\", or 14,520\n               ft\n               \n                  3\n                  \n               . See Section 1.6.2.A, Capture Volume or Water Quality Volume, for this base formula.\n\n               Assuming the above criteria is met, the use of porous pavement would allow the design\n               engineer to deduct 0.5-acre from the drainage area to the site storm water control\n               measure, and thus the site behaves as if it is 4.5 acres with 2.0 impervious acres,\n               or 44.4% impervious cover. This reduces the required water quality volume from 0.80\"\n               to 0.744\" and the drainage area is also reduced from 5 acres to 4.5 acres. The required\n               water quality volume with porous pavement is thus 12,161 ft\n               \n                  3\n                  \n               , or about a 6% reduction.\n\n               10.\n\n               References.\n\n               1.\n\n               USEPA, NPDES, Stormwater Best Management Practices, cfpub.epa.gov/npdes/stormwater/\n\n               2.\n\n               Lower Colorado River Authority, Highland Lakes Watershed Ordinance, Water Quality\n               Management Technical Manual, July 1, 2007, 4-57\n\n               3.\n\n               Urban Drainage and Flood Control District, Urban Storm Drainage Criteria Manual Volume\n               3, Best Management Practices, November 2010, pp. 6-15\u20146-17\n\n               4.\n\n               Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, RG-348 Complying with the Edwards Aquifer\n               Rules Technical Guidance and Best Management Practices, July 2005, pp. 3-25\u20143-26\n\n               5.\n\n               Ferguson, Bruce K., 2005.

    "content": "1.\n            \n            Introduction. Additional non-required vegetation, especially trees, can help reduce\n            stormwater runoff and enhance ground water recharge by breaking the impact of raindrops\n            and improving soil structure. A tree's effectiveness in this capacity is correlated\n            with the size of the crown and root zone area. There are numerous environmental and\n            stormwater benefits to additional vegetation. Non-required vegetation can act as natural\n            stormwater management area by filtering particulate matter, including pollutants,\n            some nutrients, sediments, and pesticides, and by absorbing water. A study done by\n            the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Center for Urban Forest Research found that a\n            medium-sized tree can intercept 2,380 gallons of rain per year (Center for Urban Forest\n            Research 2003). A factor that can reduce the life and health of trees in urban areas,\n            and thus their effectiveness, is compaction of or pavement over root systems. The\n            criteria below are designed to protect the root system.\n            \n            Non-required vegetation is eligible for water quality credit except in watersheds\n            within the Barton Springs Zone and Contributing Barton Springs Zone.\n            \n            2.\n            \n            Water Quality Credit and Design Guidelines.\n            \n            For water quality credit purposes, non-required vegetation can be deducted from the\n            drainage area used for sizing the water quality control; however it is not eligible\n            for impervious cover credit.\n            \n            The following factors affect non-required vegetation Water Quality credit:\n            \n            \u2022\u2002The available planting area, see ECM 3.5.0;\n            \n            \u2022\u2002The anticipated rate of survival of vegetation planted;\n            \n            \u2022\u2002The quantity of vegetation to be planted; and\n            \n            \u2022\u2002The types of vegetation proposed.\n            \n            The vegetation area eligible for credit is the 25-year growth root system. For trees,\n            the root system is assumed to be equal to the canopy cover. To be eligible for credit\n            the entire spatial area of the 25-year root system must be pervious (landscape and/or\n            porous pavement).\n            \n            Direct rainfall is assumed to be the primary source of stormwater and no off-site\n            runoff is allowed.\n            \n            Minimum soil depths of twelve (12) inches for new trees and eight (8) inches for plants\n            and grasses will be required. For the soil media requirements use the biofiltration\n            media specifications shown in Standard Specification 660S.\n            \n            For Non-required vegetation where porous pavement is used above the root zone the\n            design criteria for porous pavement should be followed, see ECM 1.6.7 (E). However, no observation ports are required for non-required vegetation.\n            \n            Note: No Water Quality credit will be given for the 25-year growth root system of\n            non-required vegetation located within vehicular parking areas. Additionally, porous\n            pavement is not allowed under stormwater hot spots or areas where land use or activities\n            generate highly contaminated runoff as described in ECM 1.6.7(E).\n            \n            3.\n            \n            Example.\n            \n            A 5 acre commercial site with 50% impervious cover (2.5 impervious acres) is required\n            to implement on-site water quality controls. The development proposes to use 0.2 acre\n            (of the 2.5 pervious acres) of non-required vegetation determined based on the 25-year\n            growth root system. Determine the water quality credit for this system.\n            \n            Without the non-required vegetation, the water quality volume required is 0.80\u2033, or\n            14,520 ft\n            \n               3\n               \n            .\n            \n            Assuming the above criteria is met, the non-required vegetation deducts 0.2-acre from\n            the site total area but does not reduce the amount of impervious cover. Thus the site\n            behaves as if it is 4.8 acres with 2.5 impervious acres, or 52.1% impervious cover.\n            This increases the required water quality volume from 0.80\u2033 to 0.821\u2033 but the drainage\n            area is also reduced from 5 acres to 4.8 acres. The required water quality volume\n            with non-required vegetation is thus 14,305 ft\n            \n               3\n               \n            or about a 1.5% reduction.\n            \n            4.\n            \n            References:\n            \n            \u2022\u2002USDA Forest Service, PSW, Center for Urban Forest Research, Rainfall Interception\n            by Santa Monica's Municipal Urban Forest, September 2003.\n            \n            Source: Rule No. R161-15.12, 1-4-2016.",

    "content": "A.\n            \n            Introduction. It has been recognized that the runoff from the two-year return frequency storm results\n            in bank-full conditions in natural streams in undeveloped watersheds. Because of its\n            frequency (approximately once every two years), this flow condition controls to a\n            great extent the shape of natural channels through the erosion that occurs during\n            these floods. Development of a watershed and the associated impervious cover which\n            results will increase not only the amount of runoff resulting from these storms, but\n            will increase the frequency at which the bank-full conditions occur. As a result,\n            streams are subject to greatly increased erosion and transport of sediment. Problems\n            which may result include streambank failures, loss of property, clogging and filling\n            of downstream waterways and receiving waterbodies, increased maintenance needs and\n            generally decreased water quality.\n            \n            On-site control of the two-year storm is required by Section 25-7-61 of the Land Development\n            Code. These guidelines shall be considered the minimum requirements for compliance\n            with that section of the Code. Alternative methods of controlling the two-year storm\n            runoff for the purpose of stream erosion control shall be submitted to the Director\n            of the Watershed Protection and Development Review Department for approval.\n            \n            B.\n            \n            Compliance. Peak runoff rates shall be calculated using the methodology described in the Drainage\n            Criteria Manual. On-site control of the two-year storm is achieved when the developed-conditions\n            peak runoff rate leaving the site for a given drainage area is less than or equal\n            to the existing-conditions runoff rate. The flowrates can be considered equal if the\n            developed rate is no more than one-half (0.5) cfs greater than the existing rate or\n            if the developed rate is no more than one-half (0.5) percent greater than the existing\n            rate and there are no existing erosion problems downstream of the site.\n            \n            Off-site control of the two-year storm is permitted when the rate of erosion will\n            not be increased between the point of discharge and the off-site facility. The use\n            of an off-site control is permitted if the following two criteria are met:\n            \n            1.\n            \n            The off-site facility controls the two-year peak flowrate. If the off-site facility\n            is not specifically designed for the two-year storm, an analysis is required to verify\n            that the facility will accomplish this. For purposes of this rule, Lake Austin, Lake\n            Travis, Town Lake and Decker Lake are considered to control the two-year peak flowrate,\n            and\n            \n            2.\n            \n            a.\n            \n            The conveyance facilities to the control are non-erodible. Stormsewers and concrete-lined\n            channels are considered non-erodible. Grass-lined channels are considered non-erodible\n            when the velocity in the channel does not exceed six (6) feet per second for a one-hundred\n            (100) year storm considering fully-developed upstream conditions, or\n            \n            b.\n            \n            The peak flowrate is not increased anywhere along the conveyance facility between\n            the site and the off-site control.\n            \n            On-site controls shall be designed in accordance with the Drainage Criteria Manual.\n            For purposes of compliance with LDC 25-7-61, the water quality volume captured in\n            the water quality control can be used to satisfy, either totally or partially, the\n            two-year detention requirement in this rule.\n            \n            C.\n            \n            Combined-function Water Quality/Detention Basins In General. For combined-function water quality/detention basins, the water quality volume must\n            be captured and isolated from the remaining flow. To hold the developed peak runoff\n            rate to existing levels, the water quality pond must capture the volume of the developed\n            hydrograph up to the point on the falling limb where the developed flowrate equals\n            the existing flowrate.\n            \n            For drainage areas of ten (10) acres or more, the developed hydrograph must be routed\n            through the water quality pond to show that the peak flow does not exceed existing\n            conditions. For drainage areas less than 10 acres, the developed flow can be routed\n            through the pond like the flow from larger areas, or the method described below may\n            be used.\n            \n            D.\n            \n            Design of Combined-function Water Quality/Detention Basins Draining Areas of Less\n               Than Ten (10) Acres. The Modified Rational Method (MRM) may be used to analyze a water quality pond for\n            two-year detention for this situation with the following modifications. The outflow\n            from the water quality will be at a significantly lower flowrate than a typical detention\n            basin. If the water quality pond is a full sedimentation/filtration basin, the allowable\n            flowrate, Qa, for use in the MRM would be the outflow through the riser pipe outlet.\n            For combined-function full sedimentation/filtration basins, the water quality volume\n            must still be released over a minimum of twenty-four (24) hours. For partial sedimentation/filtration\n            basins, the allowable outflow, Qa, is equal to the outflow rate of the sand bed, and\n            is calculated by:\n            \n            Qa = K Af(h+L)/L\n\n               where the variables are defined as in Section 1.6.10 D, but with the hydraulic conductivity (K) equal to two (2.0) feet per day.",

Pollution prevention measures shall be used to the greatest extent possible to reduce\n            the number of potential sources of pollutants on sites. For commercial and multi-family\n            sites, the applicant shall identify such potential sources of pollutants such as:\n            liquid or solid waste storage locations, storage locations for chemicals including,\n            but not limited to, pesticides, herbicides, fuels, petroleum products, hazardous wastes;\n            vehicle fueling or washing areas; storage of raw materials, by-products or products\n            of manufacturing processes; and mechanical equipment repair facilities.\n            \n            Such areas shall be identified on the site plan and in the engineer's report. In addition,\n            the report shall identify the proposed methods for the prevention of the discharge\n            of pollutants from the potential sources. Preference shall be given to measures that\n            prevent the exposure of these areas to stormwater runoff such as through covering\n            or enclosing the areas within a building. Drains from such covered or enclosed areas\n            shall not be routed to the storm drain system.\n            \n            In addition, all storm drain inlets located on commercial and multi-family sites shall\n            be stenciled by the owner with a sign which indicates that the inlet drains to local\n            creeks or waterways and that no wastes should be dumped. The design of the stencil\n            must be approved by the Director of the WPDR prior to its use on the site.\n            \n            B.\n            \n            Cadmium. In addition to the control measure design requirements for zinc in Section 1.6.9.3, this section describes the minimum requirements for pollution prevention and source\n            control measures that are required for cadmium.\n            \n            1.\n            \n            For commercial and industrial developments, the owner is required to identify any\n            proposed storage, sale, use, or process involving cadmium on the site, and develop\n            a source control plan for cadmium. This source control plan must be included in a\n            restrictive covenant referenced on the site plan, filed with the appropriate county\n            and implemented on the site.\n            \n            2.\n            \n            In addition to the items listed above, all proposed residential developments (single\n            family/duplex and multi-family) will incorporate a Public Education Program as described\n            in Section 1.6.9.2.F. of these Rules.\n            \n            C.\n            \n            Volatile Organic Compounds. Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) are those compounds defined as VOCs in the NPDES\n            Priority Pollutant listing. No calculations are required to show that VOC loads have\n            been reduced to background or baseline levels. Development subject to this ordinance\n            shall comply with the following source control and treatment methods:\n            \n            1.\n            \n            Source controls will be required for developments that propose to store, use, or dispense\n            VOCs for commercial purposes. A source control plan must be developed for these types\n            of developments and must be included in a restrictive covenant referenced on the site\n            plan, filed with the appropriate county and implemented on the site. The source control\n            plan shall include: storage of materials in areas protected from rainfall and runoff,\n            use of spill catchment devices (e.g. oil/water separators), demonstration of a spill\n            response, containment, and clean-up plan, enclosure or covering of loading/ unloading\n            areas.\n            \n            2.\n            \n            In addition to the items listed above, all proposed residential developments (single\n            family/duplex and multi-family) will incorporate a Public Education Program as described\n            in Section 1.6.9.2.F. of these rules.\n            \n            D.\n            \n            Pesticides and Herbicides. Pesticides are defined as insecticides, herbicides, rodenticides, nematocides, miticides,\n            algicides, fungicides, and molluscides. This section describes the minimum requirements\n            for pollution prevention and source control measures that are required for pesticides.\n            \n            1.\n            \n            The developer shall prepare and submit an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) plan for\n            the proposed development.\n            \n            2.\n            \n            An IPM plan should contain the following components:\n            \n            \u2022\u2002Lists of any pests (insects, mammals, plant disease, weeds, etc.) anticipated to\n            require control.\n            \n            \u2022\u2002For each pest, a hierarchy of treatments must be developed beginning with cultural,\n            mechanical, biological and other non-toxic controls, and ending with chemical control.\n            This hierarchy will determine the general sequence of control efforts to made once\n            it has been determined that a pest population has reached a level which requires control.\n            In addition to the control hierarchy, for each pest, there must be a description of\n            the monitoring plan, damage level, or other method to be used to determine when treatments\n            are necessary.\n            \n            \u2022\u2002A list of all control products included in the hierarchies, identified by active\n            ingredient and toxicity class, if necessary.\n            \n            \u2022\u2002A description of the project for which the plan has been developed (commercial,\n            residential, etc.), including approximate acreage of each landscape type(s) (i.e.,\n            turf, ornamental, etc.).\n            \n            \u2022\u2002A drawing which identifies any creek or channel draining one acre or more, spring,\n            pond, storm sewer inlet, sinkhole, cave, or fault within 150 feet of the area to be\n            maintained.\n\n               One hundred foot pesticide and fertilizer setbacks from these features are required,\n               and must be indicated on the drawing. Notwithstanding, pesticides and herbicides should\n               not be applied within the setback established for a Critical Environmental Feature.\n\n               An IPM plan is a dynamic document. The applicant may wish to tailor the plan, eliminating\n               any measures which have proven ineffective or adding additional measures to be tried.\n               Also, pest problems may arise that are not anticipated at the time of the IPM plan\n               submittal. The plan may therefore be amended with the submission and approval by WPDR\n               staff of additional or amended pest control hierarchies, or additions to other parts\n               of the plan.\n\n            3.\n            \n            For commercial and multi-family developments, a restrictive covenant and site plan\n            notes will establish the requirements for the implementation and on-going maintenance\n            of the IPM plan. This shall include information to be provided to tenants in multi-family\n            developments.\n            \n            4.\n            \n            For residential subdivision development, the developer must include plat notes approved\n            by the WPDR regarding the use of pesticides through an IPM plan.\n            \n            5.\n            \n            In addition to the items listed above, all proposed residential developments (single\n            family/duplex and multi-family) will incorporate a Public Education Program as described\n            in Section 1.6.9.2.F. of these rules.\n            \n            E.\n            \n            Turf and Landscaping Regulations. To minimize the potential for water quality impacts from chemical maintenance, the\n            maximum portion of any commercial, multi-family, or single family/duplex lot that\n            may be established as turf or landscaped is 15 percent. However, no lot shall be restricted\n            to less than 2,000 square feet of turf or landscaped area. For the purposes of this\n            rule, undisturbed natural areas or areas restored to natural conditions shall not\n            be considered landscaping or turf.

Runoff from parking lots\n            and roof tops will drain to an enclosed storm drain system designed to detain the\n            25 year design storm for the 1.3 acres of impervious cover ( = 2 acres \u00d7 .65). There\n            will be 0.2 acre of landscaped area which will drain to the parking lot. A 0.2 acre\n            picnic area will not be developed. Runoff from this area will flow overland and drain\n            into a pipe which conveys the runoff to an on-site detention pond. The remaining 0.3\n            acre will be used for drainage and water quality treatment.\n            \n            Water Quality Volume Determination - The 0.2 acre picnic area does not have to be included in the water quality volume\n            if it can be routed around the water quality pond. In addition, the 0.3 acre used\n            for water quality and detention facilities does not need to be included in the drainage\n            area.

There will be nine-2 acre lots made available, each anticipated\n            to be built at a 40 percent impervious cover level. The area of the street system\n            will be 2.0 acres built at 80 percent impervious cover. Each site is expected to leave\n            approximately 0.3 acre of land in its natural state and not hydraulically connected\n            to impervious areas. The remaining land on each site will drain to impervious area.\n            \n            Water Quality Volume Determination - Each lot will have a contributing drainage area of 1.7 acres (= 2 - 0.3) with all\n            the impervious cover within this area. The impervious cover within the drainage area\n            to the control is 0.8 acres.

If one large pond is proposed, this pond would be required to be maintained\n            by the lot owners.\n            \n            C.\n            \n            Sample Calculation for Determining Water Quality Volume - Residential Site.\n            \n            Site Description: Total Site = 45 acres\n\n               Critical Water Quality Zone = 5 acres\n\n               Water Quality Transition Zone = 10 acres\n\n               Suburban Watershed\n\n            The Critical Water Quality Zone is entirely within the 100 year floodplain. 5 acres\n            of the Water Quality Transition Zone is on steep slopes draining to a waterway and\n            will not be developed. The remaining 5 acres on the Water Quality Transition Zone\n            will be developed at 30 percent impervious cover. The 30 acres of Upland area will\n            be developed at 35 percent impervious cover.\n            \n            Water Quality Volume Determination - The Critical Water Quality Zone and 5 acres of the Water Quality Transition Zone\n            left in a natural state do not have to be included in the water quality volume. Therefore,\n            the drainage area to the control is 35 acres and the impervious cover is 12 acres.\n            The water quality capture depth is:\n            \n            water quality capture depth = 0.5 + (12/35 - 0.2) = 0.65 in.\n            \n            and water quality volume is:\n            \n            water quality volume = 35 ac. \u00d7 43,560 ft\n            \n               2\n               \n            /ac. \u00d7 0.65 in. \u00d7 1 ft/12 in. = 82,583 cf.\n            \n            The water quality volume must be based on the entire contributing drainage area, not\n            just the impervious area. If runoff from the undeveloped pervious area is routed so\n            that it does not mix with runoff from the impervious area, then the water quality\n            volume could have been based on 29.5 acres. Typically, runoff from residential areas\n            is not separable.\n            \n            D.\n            \n            Technical Basis for Sand Filtration Basin Surface Area Equations.

Actual \"k\" values (feet per day) have been\n            observed to vary from approximately 0.5 &lt; k &lt; 2.7 with an average value of about 1.5\n            feet per day. These values may appear to be conservative compared to \"textbook\" values\n            but are considered realistic due to the clogging effects of accumulated sediment loads.\n            Initial filtration runs may have higher \"k\" values but will typically drop to the\n            above quoted rates after one (1) or two (2) significant storms.\n            \n            For full sedimentation/filtration systems \"k\" is assumed to be 3.5 feet per day, or\n            0.146 feet per hour. This is about 30 percent higher than the upper limit of observed\n            values but is justified because pretreatment (by full sedimentation) will reduce filter\n            clogging and because coarse sand is specified. For partial sedimentation/filtration\n            systems \"k\" is assumed to be 2 feet per day, or 0.083 feet per hour. This is 30 percent\n            higher than the average observed \"k\" of 1.5 feet per day but is justified because\n            the pretreatment in the settling chamber will reduce some clogging. Nonetheless, clogging\n            will be greater than for the full sedimentation system and a lower permeability will\n            result. Therefore, it is clear that a larger surface area will be required for partial\n            sedimentation/filtration systems in order to achieve the same draw-down period.\n            \n            Surface Areas for Sand Filtration Basins - Plugging in the values from the \"Discussion\" section into equation (8) for Full\n            Sedimentation/Filtration Systems gives:\n\n               A\n               \n                  f\n                  \n               = [WQV(1.5)/0.146(H/2+1.5)(48)]\n\n            (9)\n            \n            A\n            \n               f\n               \n            = WQV/(2.33H+7)\n            \n            Doing likewise for Partial Sedimentation/Filtration Systems gives:\n\n               A\n               \n                  f\n                  \n               = [WQV(1.5)/0.083(H/2+1.5)(48)]\n\n            (10)\n            \n            A\n            \n               f\n               \n            = WQV/(1.33H+4)\n            \n            E.\n            \n            Sample Calculations for Wet Pond Sizing - Commercial Site\n            \n            Site Description: Total Site Area (ac) = 80\n\n               Drainage Area to Pond (ac) = 53\n\n               Impervious Cover in Drainage Area (%) = 60\n\n               Non-recharge Zone\n\n               Compsite Curve Number, RCN = 88.4\n\n               time of concentration-proposed (min) = 15\n\n            Pond Volume Determination - One wet pond is proposed to serve the 53 acres which is being developed. From Table\n            1-9, Runoff Coefficient Table, Rf is found to be 0.424.\n            \n            Permanent Pool Volume = 0.162 * Rf * DA = 0.162 * 0.424 * 53 = 3.64 ac-ft\n            \n            Twenty percent of the permanent pool volume will be held in the sediment forebay with\n            the remainder in the main pool.\n            \n            Sediment Forebay Volume = 0.2 * 3.64 = 0.73 ac-ft\n            \n            Main Pool Volume = (1 - 0.2) * 3.64 = 2.91 ac-ft\n            \n            For planning purposes, an estimate of the minimum surface area required can be calculated\n            by multiplying the percent of pond area which is to be dedicated to a function by\n            an estimate of the depth of that function. The surface area of the wet pond can be\n            estimated by assuming that 30% of the surface area is to be vegetated benches with\n            an average depth of 0.75\u2032. The 20% of the remaining 70% will be in the sediment forebay,\n            which will have an average depth of 5\u2032, and 80% will be in the main pool with an average\n            depth of 7\u2032. This is then divided by the required volume.\n\n               Extended Detention Volume\n\n               Determine the 1-year, 3-hour storm runoff volume, Q using the NRCS Curve Number method:\n\n                  Rainfall, P = 1.93 inches\n\n                  Potential Maximum Retention after rainfall begins,\n\n                  S =\n                  1000/RCN\n                  - 10 =\n                  1000/88.4\n                  - 10 = 1.31 inches\n\n                  Initial Abstraction, I\n                  \n                     a\n                     \n                  = 0.2S = (0.2)(1.31) = 0.26 inches\n\n               Determine the Extended Detention Volume (EDV). Convert runoff in inches from step 3 to acre-feet by multiplying drainage area (acres)\n               by runoff inches.\n\n               EDV\n               \n                  (ac.ft)\n                  \n               = Drainage Area \u00d7 Q \u00d7 1/12\n\n               EDV = 53 \u00d7 0.94 \u00d7 1/12 = 4.15 acre-feet\n\n               Assessing site layout, topography, and flood control needs, select an appropriate\n               configuration for incorporating the EDV into the pond design.\n\n               First, based on the required wet pool surface area, which includes the sediment forebay\n               area, design the EDV storage area within the pond. Determine the depth of the EDV\n               storage component above the design permanent pool elevation. An EDV depth of three\n               (3) to four (4) feet above the design pool elevation is recommended to minimize excessive\n               storage depths, which may require high dam embankments and negatively impact the site.\n\n               Estimated EDV depth = EDV/pond surface area = 4.15/0.75 = 5.5 feet.\n\n               Determine pond outflow characteristics to detain the 1-year, 3-hour storm for 72 hours. This approach is similar to detention pond design in that pond storage and runoff\n               must be optimized to achieve the design goal.\n\n               Using the EDV depth, divide this by two (2) to obtain the average head to approximate\n               the outlet rating curve for pond routing. Select a pipe size and develop an elevation-discharge\n               storage relationship. Head losses in the pipe may be calculated using the equation\n               Q = A * ((2*g*h)/(1+ke+kb+kf))\n               \n                  0.5\n                  \n               . For smaller drainage areas, an orifice may be required in order to achieve the required\n               72 hour drawdown. In this case the designer should check to determine if head loss\n               in the pipe or at the orifice will control the outflow rate and develop the rating\n               curve accordingly. If the flow rate is controlled by the orifice, use the orifice\n               equation Q=0.6A*(2*g*h)\n               \n                  0.5\n                  \n               . (Note: The orifice must be located at the outlet end of the pipe or in a manhole\n               to provide access to the orifice in case of blockage.)\n\n               Input the outlet rating curve and design storm, (Table 1-9A), into the hydrograph\n               model. Route the 1-year storm through the wet pond, verifying that outflow from the\n               pond continues through 72-hours. Adjust the outlet pipe/orifice size as necessary\n               to provide a minimum detention time of 72-hours.\n\n            Source: Rule No. R161-24.11, 9-6-2024.",

    "content": "These guidelines set out standards for evaluating and processing proposed modifications\n            of the 100-year floodplain with the following objectives:\n\n               \u2022\u2002preserving the natural and traditional character of the land and waterway;\n\n               \u2022\u2002encouraging sound engineering and ecological practices;\n\n               \u2022\u2002preventing and reducing degradation of water quality;\n\n               \u2022\u2002encouraging the stability and integrity of floodplains and waterways; and\n\n               \u2022\u2002restoring floodplain health to support natural functions and processes.\n\n            The guidelines apply to development that results in any vertical or horizontal change\n            in the cross section of the 100-year floodplain, both inside and outside of the Critical\n            Water Quality Zone. A vertical change in the cross section includes any change to\n            the land elevation within the floodplain, such as cut, fill, or construction of a\n            structure. A horizontal change in the cross section includes any change that widens\n            or narrows the floodplain, such as channelization. Floodplain modification is defined\n            as any change in the cross section, so compensatory cut and fill that does not change\n            the surface water elevation is still considered a floodplain modification. However,\n            development that consists solely of the addition or removal of vegetation is not considered\n            a floodplain modification. Whenever a modification to a floodplain is proposed, a\n            request for approval shall be submitted in conjunction with an application for a development\n            permit. Such permit applications shall be reviewed in accordance with the provisions\n            of these guidelines and all applicable ordinances, including Sections 25-8-364 (Floodplain\n            Modification) and 25-8-261 (Critical Water Quality Zone Development) of the Land Development\n            Code. Note: These guidelines address the environmental aspects of floodplain modification.\n            Separate drainage requirements (e.g., no adverse flooding impact) can be found in\n            Chapter 25-7 (Drainage) and the Drainage Criteria Manual.\n            \n            Naturally functioning streams with connected floodplains dissipate stream energy,\n            reduce soil erosion, reduce flood damage, capture and treat pollutants, and promote\n            sustainable healthy ecosystems. Periodic flood flows that overtop the banks of stream\n            areas are essential to the health of riparian corridors. The seasonal variability\n            of flow and intermittent extreme events combine to shape the physical structure and\n            biological diversity of floodprone areas. Healthy riparian zones filter pollutants\n            from surface runoff and increase the baseflow of our waterways, thus improving water\n            quality. Also, by providing shading and moderating water temperature, natural floodplains\n            increase biodiversity and promote healthy riparian and aquatic habitats, improving\n            water quality and the overall health of creeks.\n            \n            Source: Rule No. R161-14.08, 3-5-2014; Rule No. R161-18.05, 6-12-2018.",

These projects shall improve\n            floodplain and riparian zone function using stream restoration techniques that limit\n            the use of hard armor except as needed at key erosive locations. The project shall\n            retain the natural stable creek plan, profile, and dimension with natural function,\n            to the greatest extent practicable, using the following techniques: graded slopes\n            with soil retention blankets; vegetated mechanically stabilized earth; native riparian\n            vegetation; natural materials such as native limestone (instead of gabions or concrete);\n            toe wood; and constructed riffles that double as grade control where required for\n            vertical channel stability.

    "content": "The functional assessment is a quantitative tool designed to measure the health of\n            the floodplain. There are three zones that potentially will be assessed, depending\n            on the type of proposal:\n\n               \u2022\u2002Zone 1 - Zone 1 is the area proposed for floodplain modification outside of the Critical Water\n               Quality Zone. The applicant will use five measures to assess the current condition\n               of the floodplain (poor/fair/good/excellent) to determine if floodplain modification\n               is allowed without a variance. A floodplain in good condition or better will require\n               a land use commission variance. If the functional assessment needs to be performed\n               between November and February, the assessment may be performed by staff from the Watershed\n               Protection Department, due to a seasonal lack of vegetation.\n\n               \u2022\u2002Zone 2 - Zone 2 is the area proposed for restoration within the Critical Water Quality Zone\n               but outside of the stream channel (see Section 1.7.5). The applicant will use seven measures to assess the current condition of the riparian\n               zone (poor/fair/good/excellent) to determine which restoration techniques (if any)\n               should be applied. The assessment will also be used post-project to assess the successful\n               completion of the restoration. To demonstrate successful completion, the project will\n               need to elevate the function of the restored area from poor or fair condition to good.\n               A Critical Water Quality Zone already in good condition or better will require off-site\n               mitigation instead of restoration (see Section 1.7.6). If the functional assessment needs to be performed between November and February,\n               the assessment may be performed by staff from the Watershed Protection Department,\n               due to a seasonal lack of vegetation.\n\n               \u2022\u2002Zone 3 - Zone 3 is only assessed if the applicant is proposing modification of the active\n               channel. The assessment of both the existing stream function as well as the assessment\n               of future stream function based on the proposed design may be performed by staff from\n               the Watershed Protection Department. The 25 measures will evaluate the riparian zone,\n               the channel geomorphology, and the aquatic habitat. To provide a significant, demonstrable\n               environmental benefit, the project will need to elevate the stream function from poor\n               condition to good.\n\n            For an explanation of each functional assessment measure, including methodology and\n            scoring, see Appendix X of this manual (Functional Assessment of Floodplain Health).\n            \n            Source: Rule No. R161-14.08, 3-5-2014.",

A restoration plan must contain the following minimum components:\n\n               \u2022\u2002Soil Amendments\n\n               \u2022\u2002Native Species Seeding\n\n               \u2022\u2002Tree Seedling Planting\n\n               \u2022\u2002Exotic Invasive Species Control\n\n               \u2022\u2002Ragweed Management\n\n               \u2022\u2002Performance Criteria\n\n            During the course of inspections and field observations, adjustments to the Riparian\n            Restoration Plan may be required. The plan may be amended with the submission of additional\n            or amended parts of the plan and approval by the Watershed Protection Department.\n            \n            Riparian restoration will likely need additional time beyond the period of construction\n            to successfully elevate the function of the restored area to a good condition. Projects\n            which have not completed the riparian restoration process before the final environmental\n            inspection may enter into a Developer's Agreement for up to three years. The fiscal\n            posting amount for the Developer's Agreement shall be based on contractor estimates\n            of current cost for the materials and labor for installation and maintenance outlined\n            in the approved Riparian Restoration Plan. The estimates must be dated within 12 months\n            of the request for an agreement and must list suppliers who can provide the required\n            items. A certified estimate must be submitted to the City of Austin Environmental\n            Inspector by a landscape architect or professional engineer for review and acceptance\n            before a Developer's Agreement is written. The fiscal is returned only after a concurrence\n            letter for restoration is received and the final inspection is passed.\n            \n            B.\n            \n            Restoration Guidance\n            \n            The overall goal of the restoration should be to elevate the function of the restored\n            area from poor or fair condition to good. Restoration of floodplain function should\n            focus on a passive approach that promotes managed succession and a minimal need for\n            ongoing management. Restoration strategies and plant palettes will vary depending\n            on the zone (hydric vs. mesic), the ecoregion (Edwards Plateau vs. Blackland Prairie),\n            and the drainage area (minor vs. major waterways). Strategies should include simple,\n            straightforward techniques such as seeding, bare-root saplings, invasive removal,\n            and soil amendments rather than a more formal design involving containerized plants\n            and irrigation. Once completed, projects should demarcate restoration areas with signage\n            or boulders to prevent future clearing or mowing.\n            \n            C.\n            \n            Channel Design\n            \n            Where modification of the channel is permitted (e.g., necessary to protect public\n            health and safety, significant, demonstrable environmental benefit), design criteria,\n            calculation of flood flows and limiting velocities shall be in accordance with the\n            Drainage Criteria Manual. Innovative methods of design and construction which are\n            intended to emulate natural watercourses, promote channel stability, preserve existing\n            vegetation, preserve or improve in-stream aquatic habitat, and protect mature riparian\n            landscapes are encouraged, subject to approval by the Watershed Protection Department.\n            \n            Source: Rule No. R161-14.08, 3-5-2014.",

The impervious cover requirements of Chapter 25-8,\n            Subchapter A do not restrict impervious cover on a single-family or duplex lot but\n            apply to the subdivision as a whole. This section does not apply to impervious cover\n            calculations for the purposes of complying with Chapter 25-7 of the Land Development\n            Code.\n            \n            B.\n            \n            Impervious cover is defined as the total area of any surface that prevents the infiltration\n            of water into the ground, such as roads, parking areas, concrete, and buildings. Impervious\n            cover calculations shall include all roads, driveways, parking areas, buildings, concrete,\n            and other impermeable construction covering the natural land surface. Buildings or\n            structures raised above the ground (e.g., pier and beam foundation) shall be considered\n            impervious cover. Unpaved roads, driveways, and parking areas compacted by vehicle\n            use shall be considered impervious cover. Solar panel base and foundations are considered\n            impervious cover, while solar panels shall be counted at 50 percent of the area of\n            the panel if located within an area considered pervious.\n            \n            For an uncovered wood deck that has drainage spaces between the deck boards and that\n            is located over a pervious surface, 50 percent of the horizontal area of the deck\n            shall be counted as impervious. A covered deck shall be considered impervious. Also,\n            for a site used for the storage of scrap and metal salvage, including auto salvage,\n            the entire designated scrapyard storage area shall be considered impervious cover.\n            \n            Areas used on an ongoing or permanent, operational basis for the storage of dirt,\n            rocks, or gravel shall be considered impervious cover. Spoils piles on a permitted\n            construction site are not considered impervious cover.

    "content": "The intent of the following section is to assist applicant in the identification of\n            critical environmental features (CEFs) by providing general criteria and specific\n            indicators for the field identification of CEFs not included in the general definition\n            stated in LDC 25-8-1, 30-5-1 and ECM 1.10.3 defined in LDC 25-8-1 and 30-5-1.\n\n               A.\n\n               Bluffs are an abrupt vertical change in topography of more than 40 feet with an average\n               slope steeper than four feet of rise for one foot of horizontal travel (400% or 76\n               degrees). Bluffs are any steep slopes in soil, rock, or alluvial deposits that meet\n               the dimensions and slope requirements stated above and are not manmade cuts such as\n               roadside rock outcrops and active rock quarry walls. Generally, bluffs are associated\n               with riparian areas.\n\n               B.\n\n               Canyon Rimrocks are an abrupt vertical rock outcrop of more than 60% slope (31 degrees), greater\n               than 4 feet vertically, and a horizontal extent equal or greater than 50 feet. All\n               outcrops that meet the dimensions and slope requirements stated above are critical\n               environmental features. Rock outcrop means naturally occurring aggregate of one or\n               more minerals that are visible at the Earth's surface such as Quaternary-age alluvial\n               deposits, basalt, limestone, shale, or claystone layers. Rock outcrop does not mean\n               soil. Rimrocks are continues rock layers or beds that are traceable along the slope\n               for 50 feet. A person measuring the length of canyon rimrock should not interpret\n               any faulting and fracturing of the rock outcrop and/or mass wasting covering a portion\n               of the outcrop is not a break in the overall length of the feature. Canyon rimrock\n               do not include man-made cuts such as roadside rock outcrops and rock quarry walls.\n               Generally, rimrocks are associated with riparian areas and tributary canyons.\n\n               C.\n\n               Point Recharge Features consist of several types of natural openings and topographic depressions formed by\n               the dissolution of limestone that lies over the Edwards Aquifer recharge zone and\n               may transmit a significant amount of surface water into the subsurface. Point recharge\n               feature means a cave, sinkhole, a fault, joint or other natural features.\n\n               1.\n\n               Caves are natural underground voids formed by the dissolution of limestone and are\n               large enough for a person to enter. Applicants must determine the subsurface extent\n               of all caves identified on their property. If a cave map is not available, the applicant\n               should then conservatively estimate the cave footprint to be within 300 feet of the\n               cave's entrance or have the cave passage surveyed. Geologist may use at least two\n               rock cores along with geophysical surveys methods to determine the cave's dimensions.\n               Rock cores should be located with the intent to correlate anomalies and to verify\n               the finding of the geophysical survey. The cores should extend least five feet beyond\n               the depth of the geophysical surveys results.\n\n               2.\n\n               Fractures also referred to as a parting or a joint; are a measureable, larger than\n               hairline, separation in a rock. Only those fractures that are solution enlarged (or\n               fissures) and show evidence of direct or indirect of potential infiltration are CEFs.\n\n               3.\n\n               Faults are fractures along which there has been displacement of the rocks on one side\n               of the fracture relative to the other side. Not all faults and fractures are CEFs.\n               A CEF determination for all faults must demonstrate that there has been solution-enlargement\n               of the fault, the solution-enlargement should extend into subsurface and show direct\n               or indirect evidence of potential infiltration.\n\n               4.\n\n               Joints are fractures (see fracture above).\n\n               5.\n\n               Other natural features are all natural cavities formed by the dissolution of limestone\n               that are too small for a person to enter or are smaller than 18 cubic feet that are\n               not epikarst features or a clustering of epikarst features. Epikarst is the zone of\n               weathering at the upper surface of a limestone that includes the solutionally modified\n               (karren) bedrock surface and the overlying and include the regolith. Other natural\n               recharge features include solution cavities and swallow holes or swallets. Swallet\n               is used in a general sense to indicate the place where losing (or sinking) streams\n               infiltrate into the subsurface. Swallets can vary in shape and size. The transportation\n               and deposition of organic debris, soil, sediment, and gravel by the stream or creek\n               during periods when it is flowing may obscure swallets. Stream gauging is the best\n               method for detecting a swallet hole.\n\n               6.\n\n               Sinkholes are topographic depressions formed by karst dissolution of limestone that\n               have bowl volume of at least 18 cubic feet. Sinkhole formation implies that karst\n               processes including collapse, soil sapping, and subsidence has caused the land surface\n               to sink relative to the surrounding area. The amount of subsidence can be subtle,\n               as little as 6-inches in cross-section; the subsidence may have a funnel-shaped pit,\n               a vertical shaft, or a bowl shape. Exposed rock may be present at the perimeter of\n               the sinkhole. Land clearing activities may have obscured many sinkholes by filling\n               and covering them with soil fill material, trash, brush, and rock. To be defined as\n               a CEF, a sinkhole must exhibit either direct and/or indirect evidence of potential\n               infiltration. Sinkholes may also contain a cave.\n\n               Karst features that may not be CEFs include closed and karst depressions, karren,\n               and epikarst features. They are immature karst features that are associated with surficial\n               weathering of limestone or the weathered zone at the soil/bedrock interface\u2026 A brief\n               description of these immature karst features is below:\n\n               1)\n\n               Closed depressions that have a bowl volume of less than 18 cubic feet. These features\n               should be hand-excavated to confirm that they do not have a karst origin or direct\n               or indirect evidence of potential infiltration.\n\n               2)\n\n               Karst depressions are closed depressions that have a bowl volume of less than 18 cubic\n               feet. These features should be hand-excavated to confirm that they lack evidence of\n               potential infiltration.\n\n               3)\n\n               Karren is minor surficial dissolution or weathering of limestone. They are not CEFs\n               but may be associated with CEFs.\n\n               4)\n\n               Epikarst is the upper weathered rock zone where limestone dissolution occurs at the\n               surface or beneath the soil. The extent of the dissolution will diminish with depth.\n               They are not CEFs but may be associated with CEFs.\n\n               Over the Edwards Aquifer Recharge Zone, an engineer qualified to practice geology\n               (ECM 1.12.2) and/or a geologist (ECM 1.12.2) familiar with local hydrogeological characteristics and ordinance objectives should\n               determine the occurrence of karst features by completing a karst survey. The survey\n               method should consist of walking transects 50 feet apart across the project site completed\n               by a Texas Licensed Geoscientist in the discipline of geology with experience in Central\n               Texas.\n\n               Direct evidence of recharge includes flow observations, decreased flow downgradient\n               of a point recharge feature, the presence of flow indicators, brief duration of ponding,\n               a positive infiltration or percolation test and the detection of air movement. The\n               observation of surface flow infiltrating into the feature is direct evidence of rapid\n               infiltration. For point recharge features located in drainages with flowing water,\n               verifying infiltration is determined by a direct measurement of a decrease of surface\n               flow downgradient of a point recharge feature. Indicators of potential infiltration\n               include the presence of erosion and depositional patterns such as debris lines, high\n               water markers, leaf litter lines, and drainage patterns. Flow indicators should be\n               evaluated even if the recharge feature has an accumulation of soil, sticks, and leaves.\n               A person may prefer to conduct an on-site infiltration or percolation test at a potential\n               recharge feature to demonstrate the presence or absence of recharge. An infiltration\n               result of greater than 1 x 10\n               \n                  -6\n                  \n               cm/sec is a positive infiltration result. In addition, the brief duration of ponding\n               water in a closed depression is an indicator of rapid infiltration. Short duration\n               of ponding indicates that infiltration is likely related to a subsurface conduit that\n               is partially plugged. Air movement into or out of a karst opening is an indication\n               of significant interconnected subsurface conduits and passageways. Air movement may\n               not always be noticeable, depending upon atmospheric conditions.\n\n               Indirect evidence of recharge includes the presence and characteristics of subsurface\n               voids as determined by geotechnical or geophysical investigations or speleological\n               surveys, the sapping of fines through epikarst, or an interpreted karst origin suggesting\n               the capacity of rapid infiltration.\n\n               Potential karst features filled with rock, soil, trash, or leaves must be excavated,\n               and their relative infiltration rate assessed. Recharge features may be partially\n               plugged from the natural or anthropogenic deposition of sediment. Historically, recharge\n               features may have been filled with trash or rocks or other fill, which may obscure\n               a recharge feature. The probing and excavation through materials to expose the opening\n               or underlying bedrock is preferred. Soil filling of a point recharge feature does\n               not rule out potential infiltration. In some cases, heavy equipment may be needed\n               to excavate and adequately assess the feature. This level of investigation requires\n               written approval from TCEQ, if in their jurisdiction under the Edwards Aquifer Protection\n               Program, and/or from the City of Austin Watershed Protection Department. Please refer\n               to TCEQ's Instructions to Geologists (TNRCC\u20140585) for details. Notification for hand\n               excavation is not required; however, protocol must follow U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services\n               Requirements for Conducting Presence/Absence Surveys for Endangered Karst Invertebrates\n               in Central Texas (September 8, 2011). Excavations should extend into the subsurface\n               until bedrock or a karst conduit is encountered. The geologist must document the excavation\n               of all potential recharge features by taking photographs, descriptions and measurements\n               before, during and after excavation of a feature and include this information in the\n               ERI report.\n\n               D.\n\n               Springs and Seeps are points or zones of natural groundwater discharge that produce measurable flow\n               , or a pool of water, or maintain a hydrophytic plant community (refer to Facultative-wet\n               or Obligate plant species as listed in the National List of Plant Species That Occur\n               in Wetlands, South Plains, Region 6, U.S. Department of the Interior, Washington D.C.),\n               or other physical indicators; especially during drought conditions.

An area shall\n               be classified as a wetland if it meets the Army Corps of Engineers three parameter\n               technical criteria as outlined in the Corps of Engineers 1987 Wetlands Delineation\n               Manual (Section D. Routine Determinations):\n\n               The identification of wetlands should be completed by someone familiar with the Army\n               Corps of Engineers three-parameter technical criteria as outlined in the Corps of\n               Engineers 1987 Wetlands Delineation Manual (Section D. Routine Determinations). The\n               three parameters for wetland determination include prevalence of hydrophytic vegetation,\n               hydric soil formation, and the presence of adequate hydrology. The recommended routine\n               method assumes adequate hydrology and hydric soils if if the area under examination\n               is dominated (over 50% vegetative cover) by Facultative-wet and/or Obligate plant\n               species (as listed in the National List of Plant Species That Occur in Wetlands, South\n               Plains, Region 6, U.S. Department of the Interior, Washington D.C.) and an abrupt\n               boundary is evident between these Facultative-wet and/or Obligate plant community\n               and the Upland plant communities. If the area is dominated by Facultative plant species,\n               the hydric soil and hydrology parameters cannot be assumed and must be examined to\n               determine if an area is a wetland.\n\n               Permitted water quality wet ponds, roadside ditches, and ponds fed by wells or other\n               artificial sources of hydrology are not considered wetlands.\n\n               Atypical situations are unauthorized activities such as the alteration or removal\n               of wetland vegetation, placement of dredge or fill material over hydric soils, construction\n               of levees, drainage systems, or dams that significantly alter the wetland hydrology\n               are considered as atypical situations. Wetland areas under these circumstances should\n               be delineated in accordance to Section F of the Corps of Engineers 1987 Wetlands Delineation\n               Manual.\n\n            Source: Rule No. R161-14.25, 12-30-2014.",

    "content": "The establishment of CEF protective buffers is required by Code and as part of the\n            Environmental Resource Inventory (ERI) report. The standard buffer distance for all\n            CEFs is 150 feet with 300 feet maximum for point recharge features. Buffers are also\n            three-dimensional, extending across the land as well as above and below the land surface.\n            The intent of this section is to explain the reasons for buffering CEFs and to provide\n            guidance for determining CEF buffers.\n            \n            The Watershed Protection Department may administratively reduce the standard buffer\n            or approve wetland mitigation. Wetland mitigation occurs at least at a 1:1 ratio for\n            wetland CEFs and their associated 150 feet buffer. In general, the standard CEF buffers\n            are not administratively reduced below 50 feet for point recharge features and springs.\n            The director may grant a variance to the standard buffers described in Subsection\n            (B) only after determining that the development proposed with the variance meets the\n            objective of the requirement for which the variance is requested. In regards to critical\n            environmental features, the minimum standard for the conservation of and the development\n            around a CEF is:\n\n               1.\n\n               For a property within the Barton Springs Zone, the granting of the variance will result\n               in water quality that is at least equal to the water quality achievable without the\n               variance.\n\n               2.\n\n               All characteristics of the CEF will be preserved and additional protective measures\n               are provided to maintain or enhance the feature. The CEF existing characteristics\n               include the surrounding vegetation, ecological habitat, natural hydrology, and the\n               water quality and quantity benefits associated to the feature.\n\n               3.\n\n               The variance, if granted, must be a minimum departure from the Code. In regards to\n               CEF buffers, minimum departure means by providing the maximum buffer distance feasible.\n               Feasibility is not based on marketing or economic considerations or unique conditions\n               derived because of the method by which a person voluntarily subdivides or develops\n               land, except as provided under the \"Hardship Provisions\" of Section 25-8-25 of the\n               LDC.\n\n            If the Watershed Protection Department denies an applicant's request for a buffer\n            reduction per LDC 25-8-42, then the applicant may request a Land Use Commission variance\n            in accordance with LDC 25-8-41.\n\n               A.\n\n               Bluffs &amp; Canyon Rimrocks - Construction of impervious cover and land use activities in the upslope area adjacent\n               to canyon rimrocks and bluffs often results in an increase in the velocity and the\n               frequency of surface water runoff flowing over canyon rimrocks and bluffs. The resulting\n               erosion associated with the increased runoff causes sediment-laden runoff to enter\n               down-gradient watercourses and causes slope instability, particularly in those rimrocks\n               and bluffs with underlying clay soils or shales. The entrained sediment in runoff\n               water often has water quality contaminants attached that can accumulate in the watercourses\n               downstream.\n\n               If a steep rock outcrop area meets the requirements for a bluff or canyon rimrock\n               as stated in ECM 1.10.3(A), then the standard buffer required is 150 feet. An applicant may request and reduce\n               this buffer distance to less than 150 feet if:\n\n               1.\n\n               The upgraded slopes do not exceed 15% and the average slope does not exceed 10%.\n\n               2.\n\n               There is no evidence of erosion and/or preferential flow paths within 50-ft. of the\n               crest of the bluff or canyon rimrock.\n\n               3.\n\n               The rimrock is stable and there is no evidence of instability such as rock mass-wasting\n               of the slope or undercutting.\n\n               Recommended protective measures for granting a reduction of the buffer for a rimrock\n               or bluff CEF include:\n\n               1.\n\n               Provide or enhance up-gradient vegetation within 50 feet of rimrock to at least 95%\n               vegetative cover, with unvegetated areas not exceeding 10 square feet.\n\n               2.\n\n               Provide structural controls to spread the water over the land up-gradient of the rimrock\n               to achieve sheet flow through the buffer area.\n\n               3.\n\n               Provide additional CEF buffer area equal to or greater than the standard buffer area\n               along the drainage on site.\n\n               B.\n\n               Point recharge features are conduits for karst aquifer recharge. Epikarst features are not CEFs, however\n               they provide the subsurface drainage network of fractures, conduits, and voids that\n               store and transport water to the recharge feature. Knowledge of the full underground\n               extent of any subsurface voids associated with a point recharge feature and its associated\n               catchment area will aid in determining the appropriate buffer size.\n\n               Construction around point recharge features can alter surface, epikarst and subsurface\n               drainage patterns or sever karst conduits that may carry water to the aquifer or nearby\n               springs and seeps and wetlands. The increase in impervious cover and land use activities\n               within the catchment area for a point recharge feature can diminish the water quality\n               of water infiltrating into an aquifer by increasing contaminant load. The establishment\n               of a protective buffer is a standard approach to reduce the effects of urbanization\n               on surface and subsurface water inflows into the aquifer. The purpose of the buffer\n               is to protect water quality and quantity through the protection of the native vegetation;\n               the surface, subsurface and epikarst drainage patterns; and to maintain compatible\n               land-use activities up-gradient and overlying the point recharge feature.\n\n               1.\n\n               Standard Buffers - The standard buffer for point recharge features is dependent on the surface and\n               subsurface characteristics of the feature and surrounding land use and conditions.\n               The buffer should extend to protect the surface drainage area to the feature and the\n               subsurface extent of caves. In some cases where several point recharge features occur\n               in close proximity (i.e., two (2) or more features within a 1.6-acre area or 150 feet),\n               buffer provisions may be applied collectively or buffers may overlap, provided that\n               the minimum standard buffer for each feature is retained. Buffers are also three-dimensional,\n               extending across the land as well as above and below the land surface.\n\n               a.\n\n               Surface expression and drainage - The standard buffer shall be 150 feet measured from the edge of the immediate catchment\n               area of the point recharge feature. If the catchment area of the recharge feature\n               extends beyond 150 feet, the buffer zone may extend up-gradient to a maximum 300 feet\n               measured from the edge of the immediate catchment area of the karst feature.\n\n               b.\n\n               Subsurface (cave footprint) - The standard buffer also shall extend 150 feet, as measured from the surface projection\n               of the cave footprint. For a mapped cave, if the accessible footprint extends less\n               than 100 feet from the cave opening, no additional buffer is required. For caves of\n               an unknown extent and configuration, the assumed extent of the cave is 300 feet in\n               all directions and the required buffer will be 300 feet measured from the edge of\n               the immediate catchment area of the cave.\n\n               2.\n\n               Administratively Approved Modified Buffers - An administratively reduced buffer for point recharge features may not be granted\n               to less than 50 feet.\n\n               a.\n\n               Surface expression and drainage - If the topographic break or catchment area draining to a point recharge feature\n               is less than 150 feet from the immediate catchment area, the buffer may be reduced\n               to coincide with the topographic break but not to less than 50 feet. If the catchment\n               area of the recharge feature extends beyond 150 feet but is less than 300 feet, the\n               buffer zone may be reduced to coincide with the topographic break as measured from\n               the edge of the immediate catchment area of the karst feature.\n\n               Reductions in the standard buffer should not occur if any of the following are present\n               within the catchment area or standard setback area:\n\n               1)\n\n               Where epikarst bedrock is exposed at surface.\n\n               2)\n\n               Where direct evidence of potential infiltration is present (See ECM 1.10.3.C).\n\n               3)\n\n               A fracture zone is present within 150-ft.\n\n               4)\n\n               A fault is present within 150 feet of the recharge feature.\n\n               5)\n\n               A cave footprint is within 50 feet of the surface.\n\n               6)\n\n               There are springs and/or seeps CEFs within 500 feet of the recharge feature.\n\n               7)\n\n               The vegetation cover within the catchment area is less than 95% and bare soil areas\n               larger than 10 feet by 10 feet are present.\n\n               8)\n\n               The upslope area beyond the standard buffer has an impervious cover greater than 40\n               percent; or\n\n               9)\n\n               The upslope area drains off of roadways, parking lots, commercial, office or retail\n               land uses or residential lots of SF-4 or greater densities; or\n\n               10)\n\n               Hazardous materials regulated by the City of Austin's Hazardous Materials Storage\n               and Registration Ordinance or applicable state or federal statutes are or will be\n               stored or used adjacent to the catchment area; or\n\n               11)\n\n               The upslope area above the feature drains an area that is managed or landscaped in\n               a way (e.g., with herbicides or pesticides) which presents a reasonable doubt that\n               water quality can be protected.\n\n               b.\n\n               Subsurface (cave footprint) - The cave footprint must be protected by at least a 50 foot buffer. Since factors\n               potentially impacting water quality and quantity in caves are less understood and\n               more complex than for surface features, reductions in the standard buffer around a\n               cave footprint will be determined on a case-by-case basis. Factors for consideration\n               include:\n\n               1)\n\n               Depth of the cave from the surface.\n\n               2)\n\n               Extent of the cave.\n\n               3)\n\n               Development of the cave along structural features such as faults and fractures.\n\n               4)\n\n               Epikarst bedrock is exposed at the surface over or adjacent to the cave foot print.\n\n               5)\n\n               A fracture zone is present within 150-ft of the cave foot print.\n\n               6)\n\n               A fault is present within 150 feet of the cave foot print.\n\n               7)\n\n               A cave footprint is within 50 feet of the surface.\n\n               8)\n\n               There are springs and/or seeps CEFs within 500 feet of the cave.\n\n               9)\n\n               The vegetation cover within catchment area is less than 95% and bare soil areas larger\n               than 10 feet by 10 feet are present.\n\n               10)\n\n               The upslope area beyond the standard buffer has an impervious cover greater than 40\n               percent; or\n\n               11)\n\n               The upslope area drains off of roadways, parking lots, commercial, office or retail\n               land uses or residential lots of SF-4 or greater densities; or\n\n               12)\n\n               Hazardous materials regulated by the City of Austin's Hazardous Materials Storage\n               and Registration Ordinance or applicable state or federal statutes are or will be\n               stored or used adjacent to the catchment area; or\n\n               13)\n\n               The upslope area above the feature drains an area that is managed or landscaped in\n               a way (e.g., with herbicides or pesticides) which presents a reasonable doubt that\n               water quality can be protected.\n\n               Nothing prevents the voluntary protection of small karst features, which lack evidence\n               of significant recharge. A person should consider in their project design how to negate\n               the possibility of these features becoming pathways for the infiltration of contaminated\n               runoff during and after construction. Restrictions on excavation and grading activities,\n               which could expose subsurface voids or otherwise create additional avenues of recharge\n               within the construction area, may be required.\n\n               Note: The diversion of drainage out of or away from the catchment area of a point\n               recharge feature will not constitute evidence of the protection of water quality and\n               will not be considered, alone, a legitimate basis for reducing buffer zones. The provisions\n               of Section 25-8-151 of the LDC (Innovative Management Practices \u2014 see Section 1.10.6 below) provide an alternative pathway towards protection of point recharge features.\n               It should be anticipated, however, that plans relying on Section 25-8-151 of the LDC\n               would be reviewed under the highest standards of environmental reliability and engineering\n               performance.\n\n               Undesirable Pre-existing Conditions - In such situations in which actions prior to the effective date of the Comprehensive\n               Watershed Ordinance (May 18, 1986) resulted in incompatible land use within the drainage\n               catchment of a point recharge feature, or in degraded runoff being diverted to the\n               feature, mitigation actions should be taken in conjunction with any proposal and are\n               subject to these criteria. The following solutions should be sought as part of any\n               new development proposal, in the following order of preference:\n\n                  \u2022\u2002Re-establish required buffers in accordance with these criteria;\n\n                  \u2022\u2002Employ innovative management practices to improve the quality of runoff entering\n                  the recharge feature; and lastly\n\n                  \u2022\u2002Divert untreated runoff from the point recharge feature.\n\n               Newly Discovered or Identified Features. If, after development has begun, a karst feature becomes a point recharge feature\n               (e.g., by excavation of a previously undetected large underground void), a person\n               must report the occurrence in writing to the Watershed Protection Department (LDC\n               25-8-281 (D)). The report shall contain an evaluation of the significance of the point\n               recharge feature and a plan to mitigate any negative impacts, if necessary. (see ECM:\n               Void and Water Flow Mitigation 1.12.0)\n\n               C.\n\n               Springs and seeps - The protection of springs and seeps helps to maintain baseflow of Austin Area creeks.\n               Baseflow is essential for maintaining water levels in local reservoirs. Springs or\n               seeps that are located up-gradient of the recharge zone maintain water quantity in\n               local aquifers. Spring/seep buffers protect the spring orifice or zone of seeps from\n               disturbance and help preserve their groundwater flow paths.\n\n               The reduction of the standard buffer for springs/seeps is rare. Often the standard\n               buffer is not adequate for protecting the ground water flow paths to springs/seeps\n               from surrounding trenching and construction activities which can alter the groundwater\n               flow paths to them. Spring and seeps buffers are only reduced if there is preexisting\n               development within the setback area. In the case for buffer reductions, the greatest\n               maximum setback distance should be provided, so that is it a minimum departure from\n               the 150 feet required. Buffer for springs and seeps can only be administratively reduced\n               to 50 feet on case-by-case basis and only if the applicant provides justification\n               that the flow quantity and quality shall be preserved. A site-specific investigation\n               of the hydrogeologic conditions associated with the spring or seep is required. Recommended\n               protective measures for granting, on a case-by-case basis, a reduction of the buffer\n               for a spring and seeps CEF included both:\n\n               1.\n\n               Provide additional CEF buffer equal to or greater than the standard buffer area along\n               the drainage on site.\n\n               2.\n\n               Prohibit subsurface activities within 150 feet of spring or seep.\n\n               Applicants must demonstrate that proposed measures preserve all characteristics of\n               the spring or seep, per LDC 25-8-42 (D)(3). Applicants requesting a spring or seep\n               buffer to be reduced to less than 50-ft, must seek a Land Use Commission variance\n               in accordance with LDC 25-8-41.\n\n               D.\n\n               Wetlands - The protection of wetlands and the ecosystem services they provide is critical\n               to maintaining and restoring the chemical, physical and biological integrity of surface\n               water resources. Among these ecosystem services, wetlands can reduce the impacts from\n               storm runoff, retain pollutants, reduce sediment, support instream baseflow, replenish\n               groundwater, sequester carbon and provide critical resources for wildlife.\n\n               1.\n\n               Standard Setback - The standard setback for a wetland CEF is a 150-foot CEF buffer\n               around the outside edge of the wetland area. The protection of the Standard Setback\n               may be appropriate to maintain the source water which supports saturation, or to maintain\n               the surrounding physical or biological characteristics which support the wetland.\n               The Standard Setback should be applied and preserved for wetlands that are fed by\n               sheet flow from multiple directions, wetlands with pronounced diversity and vigor,\n               or wetlands located in ecologically significant or sensitive areas.\n\n               2.\n\n               Administratively approved modified setback - The standard setback may be modified\n               so that the same square footage as the standard setback is applied to the natural\n               drainage patterns above and below the wetland, or to adjacent surface water resources\n               that would not otherwise be protected. The minimum setback average width should not\n               be less than 50 ft from centerline. An administratively approved modified setback\n               may be applied based on the source of water supporting the wetland, the biological\n               characteristics of the wetland and the physical characteristics of the area around\n               the wetland.\n\n               3.\n\n               Mitigation - The Wetland CEF, the standard buffer, and/or administratively approved\n               modified setback can be reduced on a case-by-case basis if 1:1 mitigation in the form\n               of in-kind and on-site wetland enhancement or replacement is provided. Enhancements\n               and replacements may include, but are not limited to, the following examples:\n\n               a.\n\n               On-site constructed wet ponds (for guidance see ECM, Section 1.6.6, Design Guidelines For Wet Ponds).\n\n               b.\n\n               On-site detention ponds landscaped with a native wet prairie (for guidance see COA\n               Standard Specification Manual, Section 609S, Native Grassland Seeding and Planting\n               For Erosion Control).\n\n               c.\n\n               Additional on-site buffers around existing water features or CEFs.\n\n               d.\n\n               On-site bio-filtration and infiltration enhancement of standard sedimentation/filtration\n               water quality and/or detention ponds.\n\n               e.\n\n               Wetland restoration or enhancement for water quality controls; appropriate for existing\n               ponds in-line with unclassified waterways or isolated ponds that can treat a development's\n               storm water runoff (ECM, Section 1.6.6).\n\n            The Director of Watershed Protection Department may grant an administrative variance\n            to further reduce setbacks for CEFs. The applicant for a variance must demonstrate\n            that the proposed measures used in place of setbacks preserve all characteristics\n            of the CEF.\n            \n            Source: Rule No. R161-14.25, 12-30-2014.",

The upslope\n            limits extend to the highest topographic contour above and around the feature, irrespective\n            of the degree of slope. A sharp slope break present at the perimeter of a well-defined,\n            bowl-shaped depression is the rim of the sinkhole and is within the catchment area.\n            \n            (2)\n            \n            CRITICAL ENVIRONMENTAL FEATURE BUFFER. A land area established to protect or mitigate\n            for the impacts to a Critical Environmental Feature (CEF). The natural vegetative\n            cover must be retained to the maximum extent practicable. Construction disturbance\n            must preserve all characteristics of the CEF and is limited to low-impact, minor modifications\n            such as trails and protective structures.\n            \n            (3)\n            \n            DRAINAGE WAY. The land surface that conveys surface flow to a larger body of water.\n            This includes any channel that concentrates stormwater runoff.\n            \n            (4)\n            \n            NATIVE VEGETATION. A native, or indigenous, species of Central Texas known to this\n            region to exist as a result of only natural processes, with no human intervention.\n            Once established, native species do not require irrigation, fertilization, or other\n            chemical support when located in appropriate habitat. Native species of trees, shrubs,\n            grasses, and wildflowers are listed in the Native Plant database of the Lady Bird\n            Johnson Wildflower Center website.\n            \n            (5)\n            \n            NUISANCE VEGETATION. Vegetation that is of an invasive or detrimental nature and may\n            be harmful to the functioning or water quality protection of a Critical Environmental\n            Feature. This may include terrestrial or aquatic plants such as kudzu (Pueraria lobata),\n            Bermuda grass (Cynodon dactylon), elephant ear (Colocasia), arundo cane (Arundo donax),\n            hydrilla (Hydrilla verticillata), and greenbriar (Smilax bona-nox L.). Refer to the\n            City of Austin Invasive Species Management Plan for additional plant species.\n            \n            (6)\n            \n            NON-MECHANIZED EQUIPMENT. Equipment that is operated by hand and may include the use\n            of hand-held motorized tools, such as chain saws.\n            \n            (B)\n            \n            The protection of a Critical Environmental Feature buffer may require perimeter controls\n            such as a perimeter fence, physical barrier, other structures, and signage. Fencing\n            must meet the specifications of the City of Austin Standard Specifications Manual\n            or a standard approved by the Watershed Protection Department. If a fence is constructed,\n            then at least one access gate with a lockable latch must be installed. Fencing is\n            recommended for the following conditions:\n            \n            (1)\n            \n            The buffer is located adjacent to industrial, commercial, multi-family, or single-family\n            residences.\n            \n            (2)\n            \n            The buffer contains the catchment area of a cave or sinkhole.\n            \n            (3)\n            \n            The buffer area contains an ecological community that is sensitive to disturbances\n            that may impact water quality or alter the natural characteristics of the Critical\n            Environmental Feature.\n            \n            (4)\n            \n            The buffer area contains steep slopes and is located outside of a Critical Water Quality\n            Zone.\n            \n            (5)\n            \n            The buffer area is potentially hazardous or dangerous to individuals.\n            \n            (6)\n            \n            The buffer area contains State or Federally protected species.\n            \n            (C)\n            \n            Cave gates may be required. The materials and construction method must be approved\n            by the Watershed Protection Department.\n            \n            (D)\n            \n            Other proposed structures, such as diversion berms or recharge enhancement structures,\n            within the buffer must retain the functionality and integrity of the Critical Environmental\n            Feature. Generally diversion berms would only be allowed inside a buffer to direct\n            clean or treated runoff toward recharge features. Otherwise, diversion berms outside\n            the buffer would direct untreated runoff away from a recharge features. The materials\n            and construction method must be approved by the Watershed Protection Department.\n            \n            (E)\n            \n            Native vegetation within the buffer must be maintained such that it provides water\n            quality benefits such as filtering sediment, allowing infiltration, promoting sheetflow\n            of stormwater runoff, and preventing erosion. This maintenance does not include the\n            requirement to provide supplemental irrigation for upland vegetation. Removal is to\n            be conducted with non-mechanized equipment and without the use of herbicides. Removal\n            of nuisance vegetation including seedling ash junipers may be conducted with prior\n            approval and documentation from the Watershed Protection Department.\n            \n            (F)\n            \n            Inspection of a Critical Environmental Feature buffer should occur at least every\n            6 months. The vegetation within the buffer area and associated infrastructure (fences,\n            gates, berms, signs, trails, etc.) should be inspected. Additional conditions, such\n            as red-imported fire ant activity, should be noted within cave buffers. Inspection\n            records must be retained for three years by the land management entity for the City\n            of Austin review.\n            \n            (G)\n            \n            The owner must maintain the area within the buffer in a natural, vegetated state and\n            preserve the natural characteristics of the Critical Environmental Feature. Maintenance\n            activities shall utilize non-mechanized equipment. Mowing of ground cover is specifically\n            not allowed. The following activities must be conducted:\n            \n            (1)\n            \n            Trash must be removed from the buffer area on an as needed basis.\n            \n            (2)\n            \n            Herbicide and pesticide use is prohibited within Critical Environmental Feature buffers\n            on sites that are subject to the Save Our Springs Ordinance, per ECM 1.6.9.2 D.\n            \n            (3)\n            \n            Upland vegetation must be replaced under the following conditions:\n            \n            (a)\n            \n            A contiguous area greater than 10% total area of the buffer has dead, native vegetation.\n            The type of vegetation may be an area of dead forbs and grasses or shrubs or trees.\n            If Austin Water Utility has implemented Stage 2 or greater water restrictions, then\n            revegetation may be postponed until watering is allowed twice per week.\n            \n            (b)\n            \n            The area must be stabilized immediately if bare soil greater than 10 square feet in\n            area results from vegetation death. Stabilization shall comply with other applicable\n            sections of the Environmental Criteria Manual.\n            \n            (4)\n            \n            Wetland vegetation located outside of a drainage way must be replaced under the following\n            conditions:\n            \n            (a)\n            \n            A contiguous area greater than 10% total area of the buffer consists of dead obligate,\n            wetland vegetation; or\n            \n            (b)\n            \n            Wetland vegetation was removed for infrastructure repair. Re-establish the hydrophytic\n            wetland plant community per original, approved site or construction plans or as approved\n            by the Watershed Protection Department.\n            \n            (5)\n            \n            Routine preventive maintenance for gates, fences and trails should occur at least\n            annually. If infrastructure damage exists, then repair must occur within two (2) months.\n            \n            (6)\n            \n            Any observed condition that represents an immediate threat to water quality or public\n            health must be remedied as soon as possible.\n            \n            (H)\n            \n            Additional maintenance activities may be required. These activities may include:\n            \n            (1)\n            \n            Trail surfaces that have eroded should be repaired within two (2) months.\n            \n            (2)\n            \n            Missing or damaged signs should be replaced within six (6) months.\n            \n            (3)\n            \n            Recharge enhancement structures should be maintained per the design recommendations.\n            This may require clearing debris and sediment on a periodic basis.\n            \n            (I)\n            \n            Any other conditions required by a legal document, such as a restrictive covenant\n            or conservation easement, shall be followed.\n            \n            (J)\n            \n            Failure to maintain a Critical Environmental Feature buffer that results in water\n            quality degradation is considered to be a violation of City Code Chapter 6-5 (Water\n            Quality).

    "content": "Where extenuating circumstances exist and development over a significant point recharge\n            feature and its catchment is proposed, the applicant should consider the following\n            guidelines:\n\n               A.\n\n               Demonstrate That No Feasible Alternatives to Construction Over the Point Recharge\n                  Feature Exist. Feasibility of alternatives shall be based primarily on technical, engineering and\n               environmental criteria. Feasibility should not be based predominantly on marketing\n               or economic considerations or special or unique conditions which are created as a\n               result of the method by which a person voluntarily subdivides or develops land, except\n               as provided under the \"Hardship Provisions\" of Section 25-8-25 of the LDC.\n\n               B.\n\n               Evaluate Alternative Recharge Areas Capable of Providing Recharge of a Quality and\n                  Quantity Approximately Equivalent to the Area Lost. Compensating recharge or other mitigation, should be provided on-site, where feasible.\n               Involved City departments will be available to discuss appropriate mitigation measures\n               and sites. In all cases, measures shall be taken to assure that the quality of enhanced\n               or induced recharge is adequate to protect ground water quality.\n\n               C.\n\n               Alternative Compensation or Mitigation Measures May be Approved by the Watershed Protection\n                  and Development Review Department. The Watershed Protection and Development Review Department may approve alternative\n               mitigation measures which achieve the objectives of maintaining recharge on a site.\n               For example, a surface water feature designed and managed to augment baseflow in an\n               adjacent stream might be accepted as compensation for loss of recharge to a local\n               ground water system feeding springs which discharge to the stream.\n\n               D.\n\n               Restoration of Karst Features. An applicant may voluntarily restore a karst feature to it's original, natural state;\n               as reasonably possible. Restoration may include removing dumped trash, rock rubble,\n               organic debris, or filled or washed in soil and restoring native vegetation according\n               to Item No. 609S of the City of Austin Standard Specifications Manual. For safety\n               reasons, opening a karst feature may necessitate installation of a cave gate to restrict\n               public access to the feature. Restoration efforts should result in improving the quantity\n               and quality of recharge water. The directing of treated or untreated stormwater to\n               a recharge feature may require a Class V injection well permit from the Texas Commission\n               on Environmental Quality.\n\n               Requests to restore karst features will be reviewed by the director of the Watershed\n               Protection Department on a case-by-case basis.\n\n            Source: Rule No. R161-14.25, 12-30-2014.",

    "subtitle": "GUIDELINES FOR EVALUATION OF LAND PROPOSED FOR APPLICATION OF TREATED WASTEWATER EFFLUENT",
    "content": "The lands in and around the Austin area, particularly the western portions, are geologically\n            and hydrologically sensitive due to the presence of the aquifer recharge zones, spring\n            fed streams and relatively shallow soils. The combination of Austin's sensitive environment\n            plus the tremendous amount of growth and variety of waste disposal practices in this\n            region raise concerns about the capabilities of ground water and surface water resources\n            to assimilate contaminants and the capacity of soil-water-plant ecosystems to attenuate\n            wastes.\n            \n            The disposal of treated wastewater effluent by irrigation is increasingly being considered\n            as an alternative to direct discharge into Austin's lakes and streams. The land application\n            of treated wastewater is warranted when the environmental conditions are suitable\n            and when adequate land is dedicated and properly managed for that purpose.\n            \n            The Land Development Code, Section 25-8-361, places restrictions on the size and location\n            of wastewater irrigation fields to ensure that the land has sufficient capacity to\n            accept, filter and treat the wastewater effluent and that the irrigation fields are\n            situated such that the impacts of the wastewater effluent on the environment may be\n            minimized. These guidelines have been developed to implement the requirements of the\n            Comprehensive Watersheds Ordinance through the characterization of soils and landscape\n            features of lands proposed to be used for application of treated wastewater effluent.\n            Two (2) main topics are covered in this document:\n            \n            The first is a methodology for determining the depth of \"effective soil\" when a request\n            is made to provide 7,000 square feet of irrigated land per living unit equivalent\n            when a minimum of six (6) inches of top soil is present rather than 8,000 square feet\n            per living unit equivalent, as allowed by the code; and,\n            \n            The second are guidelines for determining appropriate areas for irrigation, excluding\n            environmentally sensitive areas unsuited to irrigation, such as steep slopes and floodplains.",

    "content": "Projects which involve the request to vary the amount of land used for the disposal\n            of treated wastewater by irrigation, from 8,000 square feet per living unit equivalent\n            to 7,000 square feet per living unit equivalent, must complete a soil survey demonstrating\n            the presence of six (6) inches of topsoil (effective soil). Living unit equivalent\n            is referred to as defined by the Water and Wastewater Utility Department.\n\n               A.\n\n               Purpose and Justification. As required under the LDC, Section 25-8-361: \"Projects utilizing wastewater treatment\n               by land application shall have at least eight thousand (8,000) square feet of irrigated\n               land per living unit equivalent, as defined by the City of Austin's Water and Wastewater\n               Department or at least seven thousand (7,000) square feet of irrigated land per living\n               unit equivalent and six (6) inches of topsoil \u2026\"\n\n               Shallow soils and soils dominated by coarse fragments (coarse fragments being greater\n               than two (2) millimeters in size) have severely limited abilities to attenuate contaminants\n               in the treated wastewater. Deep clayey soils, on the other hand, have the chemical\n               characteristics to treat and filter wastewater, but are limited due to the physical\n               constraints of slow infiltration and percolation of wastewater.\n\n               When requesting to vary from the 8,000 square feet per living unit equivalent standard\n               a person is required to conduct an on-site appraisal of soils for each area to be\n               irrigated. An \"effective soil\" depth principle is to be applied, in order to determine\n               the availability of soil on irrigation tracts that is capable of attenuating contaminants\n               in treated wastewater. Particular attention needs to be placed on stony and shallow\n               soils in the Hill Country. Field soil surveys will assess, to some degree, the soil's\n               chemical and physical properties in order to determine the soil's ability to treat\n               and filter contaminants from the treated wastewater.\n\n               For the purpose of the City's Watersheds Regulations, topsoil and effective soil are\n               used synonymously. \"Effective soil\" is defined as that portion of the soil which is\n               most useful for attenuation of wastewater contaminants through support of bacterial,\n               chemical and physical action and plant uptake of water and nutrients. Surface soils\n               contain a variable mixture of weathered minerals, organic matter and in some cases,\n               coarse rock fragments. If coarse fragments are present, the effective topsoil volume\n               includes only that portion of the total soil volume which is the fine earth fraction\n               (&lt; two (2) millimeters in size). This fraction represents the zone of major root development,\n               bacterial activity, cation exchange and physical filtration.\n\n               B.\n\n               Guidelines.\n\n               1.\n\n               Soils Survey. A soil field survey is required with plan submission when making a request to vary\n               from the 8,000 square feet per living unit equivalent standard. A six (6) inch effective\n               soil depth is required if a request is made to provide 7,000 square feet of irrigated\n               land per living unit equivalent rather than 8,000 square feet per living unit equivalent.\n               The following field soil survey methodology shall be used to determine the actual\n               presence of six (6) inches of effective soil. The survey is divided into two segments;\n               a general survey of the entire irrigation tract and a detailed survey focusing primarily\n               on those areas that may not have six (6) inches of effective soil.\n\n               \u2022\u2002General Survey. Representative soil conditions need to be identified for the entire\n               irrigation tract in order to assess the type, amount, quality and characteristics\n               of the effective soils in the irrigation area and to identify subareas requiring further\n               study.\n\n                  A general soil survey shall be conducted by examination of shovel pits or similar\n                  technique at observation/sampling points established at regular intervals along transects\n                  throughout the irrigation area. The placement of the transects and frequency of the\n                  sampling points should be selected based on the variability of the landforms and soils\n                  at the irrigation-site.\n\n                  The United States Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service county soil\n                  survey, may be of assistance, although these soil surveys by themselves, are not detailed\n                  enough to meet the requirements of these guidelines. The interval and frequency of\n                  soil samples shall be in the range from one (1) in every two (2) to five (5) acres\n                  on representative landforms in highly dissected landscapes, to one (1) in every ten\n                  (10) to 12 acres in uniform landscapes. In no case shall the frequency of sampling\n                  points be less than one (1) in every 12 acres per representative landform.\n\n                  A generalized soil field survey map and report shall be compiled which include the\n                  following information for each irrigation tract.\n\n                  - A topographic map shall be prepared, with two (2) foot contour intervals, at a scale\n                  of one (1) inch = 100 feet showing:\n\n                     transect lines and observation/sampling points; and,\n\n                     a delineation of the United States Department of Agriculture-Soil Conservation Service\n                     soil series mapping units as verified by the field survey.\n\n                  - For each sampling/observation location, report the following field observations\n                  on physical properties:\n\n                     depth of the soil to the first semi-permeable or impermeable horizon, resistant limestone\n                     bed (e.g., flaggy limestone) or bedrock impeding the vertical movement of water. (If\n                     distance is greater than three (3) feet, record as greater than three (3) feet.)\n\n                     number and identification of master and subordinate horizons; and, generally, the\n                     percent of surface stoniness and the percent of coarse fragments (&gt; two (2) millimeter\n                     diameter) within the soil solum or matrix or within each soil horizon.\n\n                  - Based on the information collected in this general survey and on the definition\n                  of effective soil, determine and map the following breakdown for the various soil\n                  series map units:\n\n                     areas with greater than six (6) inches of effective soil;\n\n                     areas which may not have six (6) inches of effective soil; and,\n\n                     areas with less than six (6) inches of effective soil.\n\n                     In the case of the Municipal Utility District land plans, the Directors of the Watershed\n                     Protection and Development Review Department and the Water and Wastewater Utility,\n                     in agreement with the MUD, may defer some or all of the requirements of the detailed\n                     survey (below), to the preliminary plan stage of the subdivision process.\n\n               \u2022\u2002Detailed Survey. Using the information generated from the generalized soil survey, detailed soil descriptions\n               for representative areas and landforms shall be completed with special emphasis placed\n               on areas with less than six (6) inches of soil or areas which may not have six (6)\n               inches of soil.\n\n                  A minimum of ten (10) soil pits shall be opened per 100 acres of land to be irrigated.\n                  Pits should be concentrated in areas that need more detailed study in order to conclusively\n                  determine their effective soil depth. However, other areas should not be completely\n                  neglected.\n\n                  For example, in the Hill Country on Brackett soils and its various map units, two\n                  (2) pits should be opened on the risers and eight (8) pits on the benches for a 100\n                  acre irrigation tract. In cases of complex landscapes, more pits may be necessary.\n                  Pits are to be opened with a backhoe in order to determine the extent of soil development\n                  and the extent, nature and condition (fracturing, bedding characteristics, etc.) of\n                  the more resistant limestone beds such as are common in the Hill Country. Pits should\n                  be six (6) to ten (10) feet long, to a three (3) foot depth or down to the supporting\n                  bedrock, (whichever is limiting) and must show representative sections of the soil\n                  matrix.\n\n                  A detailed soil survey map and report shall be compiled which include the following\n                  information. These submittals shall be certified by a registered professional soil\n                  scientist.\n\n                  - For each soil profile displayed in each pit, report the field and laboratory observations\n                  for the following physical and chemical properties for each horizon:\n\n                     depth, master horizon designation (e.g., A, B, C, R) and the subordinate distinctions,\n                     texture including percent coarse fragments, percent stoniness at the surface, color,\n                     percent mottles, structure, consistency, presence of roots and root traces and animals\n                     and animal traces and stratigraphy and origin of materials. This information not only\n                     provides information on the depth of the effective soil, but also identifies the soil's\n                     inherent ability as a filter media;\n\n                     based on mechanical analysis conducted on each soil horizon, the percent and volume\n                     of coarse fragments in the soil matrix;\n\n                     the total depth of soil at each soil prove description-site (soil pit); and\n\n                     the thickness of effective soil, based on textures (volume of soil minus the volume\n                     of coarse fragments).\n\n                  - A topographic map shall be prepared with two (2) foot contour intervals at a scale\n                  of one (1) inch = 100 feet showing the breakdown of greater than and less than six\n                  (6) inches of effective soil.\n\n                  - For each irrigation area, report the square footage of areas with effective soil\n                  depths greater than six (6) inches.",

    "content": "This section describes criteria for notification requirements and guidance for furnishing\n            and installing mitigation measures for voids and water flow features discovered in\n            bedrock during excavation activities. This section has been developed to provide guidance\n            for response to Section 25-8-281(D) of the Land Development Code and Note 8 of Appendix\n            P-1 of the Environmental Criteria Manual that says:\n\n               \"All work must stop if a void in the rock substrate is discovered which is; one square\n               foot in total area; blows air from within the substrate and/or consistently receives\n               water during any rain event; or potentially transmits groundwater. At this time it\n               is the responsibility of the Project Manager to immediately contact a City of Austin\n               Environmental Inspector for further investigation.\"\n\n            Construction activities within 50 feet of the void must stop. Construction may only\n            proceed after mitigation measures are reviewed and approved by the Watershed Protection\n            Department, per LDC 25-8-281(D)(3).\n            \n            This section provides mitigation alternatives for use in addressing anomalous features\n            or discrete discharge points that are observed upon initial excavation (e.g., trench)\n            or that are discovered when trench backfill material is removed. The purpose of the\n            mitigation is to preserve voids and water flow features while maintaining utility\n            integrity and preventing pollution.\n            \n            This section does not apply to excavations occurring below the water table or in unconsolidated\n            earth material.

In certain cases, the Geologist or Geologist representative may\n            determine that the void requires protection prior to backfill operations. Such protection\n            would be required to prevent the interim backfill from entering the void and may consist\n            of providing plywood planking or other barricade to block the backfill. Water flow\n            features may require temporary mitigation measures as well. The Geologist representative\n            or Geologist shall establish what measures to take, if any.\n            \n            4.\n            \n            If groundwater is encountered in an area where CLSM bedding is not already specified\n            for the section of pipe, it is anticipated that CLSM bedding will be required. If\n            groundwater is encountered, but is at a rate of one gallon per minute or less, and\n            the flowing water is encountered in an area where CLSM bedding is already specified\n            for the section of pipe, no additional mitigation for the flowing water is anticipated.\n            However, void mitigation measures may still be necessary. If the discharge rate is\n            higher than one gallon per minute, additional water flow measures may be directed\n            by the Owner's Representative.\n            \n            5.\n            \n            If the void is located at the bottom of the trench, temporary void protection per\n            Class I, Standard Detail 658S-1, shall be provided at all times that trench excavation\n            is halted and until Owner's geological and biological inspections have occurred and\n            the Contractor has been given instructions on how to proceed.\n            \n            6.\n            \n            A second trench inspection may be when backfill is removed if clay-filled or fragile\n            features are present. The purpose is to re-inspect voids or features that may have\n            enlarged since the initial trenching inspection. The role of the Contractor is to\n            stabilize the trench to allow for observation of the anomaly from within the trench\n            and to provide an Excavation Safety System Plan (City of Austin Standard Specification\n            Item No. 509S). The Contractor shall be required to install all necessary safety equipment\n            to allow direct observation of the void or water flow feature. The role of the Contractor\n            is to assist in the investigation by providing access to the anomaly (e.g., ladders,\n            harness and rigging, scaffolding, etc.) and confined space safety equipment. The role\n            of the Contractor is to install all necessary shoring and trench protection. The role\n            of the Contractor's designated safety supervisor is to ensure that all OSHA requirements\n            are met during anomaly observation. The role of the Contractor is to not place pipe,\n            pipe bedding, or backfill within 50 feet (15.24 meters) of the anomaly prior to final\n            inspection by the Geologist or Geologist representative.\n            \n            7.\n            \n            The Geologist or Geologist representative shall observe, investigate and document\n            the anomaly. Documentation will include the Geologist Void Description and Documentation\n            Log Sheet (Attachment A), photos and/or sketches of the encountered void and/or water\n            flow feature.\n            \n            8.\n            \n            The Geologist and Owner's Representative shall confer regarding the anomaly and establish\n            the void and/or water flow mitigation measure to be installed. The Engineer or designated\n            representative shall verify the proposed mitigation methods and modify design drawings\n            or site plans as necessary to direct the Contractor how to implement the void and/or\n            water flow mitigation measures.\n            \n            9.\n            \n            Voids that are less than 18 cubic feet in volume, are dry, have no airflow and are\n            located at least 1 foot above the top of a utility pipe do not require a City of Austin\n            site plan correction prior to mitigation. Mitigation measures may be installed after\n            the City of Austin geologist concurs with the owner's Geologist's description and\n            the Engineer's proposed mitigation. The mitigation must be documented in a site plan\n            correction prior to completion of the project. TCEQ approval requirements must still\n            be followed, if the site is located within the TCEQ-defined Edwards Aquifer Recharge\n            Zone.\n            \n            10.\n            \n            Voids greater than 18 cubic feet (0.504 cubic meters) require a site plan correction\n            submittal and approval by the City of Austin. The Engineer or designated representative\n            will submit a site plan correction to the City of Austin for all voids encountered\n            that require mitigation measures. The site plan correction will show the surveyed\n            location of the anomaly (ies) and shall reference mitigation measures from this section.\n            The corresponding Standard Detail (s) from the 658S series shall be included in the\n            correction. The Contractor may not proceed with construction of the mitigation measures\n            or excavate or place pipe or pipe bedding or backfill within 50 feet ( 15.24 meters)\n            of the anomaly (ies) until a site plan correction is approved.\n            \n            11.\n            \n            The role of the Contractor is to construct the void and/or water flow mitigation measure\n            in accordance with the approved site plan correction. The Contractor shall notify\n            the Watershed Protection Department geologist 48 hours in advance of mitigation installation.\n            \n            12.\n            \n            Upon completion of a void and/or water flow mitigation measure installation, a Geologist\n            or Geologist representative shall inspect the work before the Contractor resumes construction\n            activities within 50 feet (15.24 meters) of the anomaly. The owner's Geologist must\n            observe and photograph the phases of the installation of the mitigation measures and\n            submit an electronic report to the Watershed Protection Department within one week.\n            \n            Source: Rule No. R161-14.25, 12-30-2014.",

A geotechnical or structural engineer must provide a cave stability analysis\n            that demonstrates that the proposed mitigation measures will minimize the risk of\n            infrastructure or cave collapse. The analysis should use a beam analysis theory model\n            and site-specific rock strength data. A geotechnical investigation or geophysical\n            survey may be needed to determine the extent, configuration and depth of the cave.\n            Geotechnical borings should be of sufficient depth to intercept potential lower levels\n            of a cave.

Install prior to covering trench\n               or temporary backfilling operations.\n\n               b.\n\n               Cover the void opening with plywood planking with a minimum of 1 foot (305 mm) distance\n               from edge of the void to the edge of the planking. Planking is to be placed to prevent\n               backfill from entering void. Place a rock (minimum weight of 5 pounds (2.3. kg)) or\n               concrete block over planking.\n\n               c.\n\n               Additional protective measures may be required, as determined by the City of Austin.\n               Measures may include erosion and sedimentation controls adjacent to or within the\n               trench or excavation, barriers to preserve moisture conditions within the void or\n               structural support for stability.\n\n               2.\n\n               Class II permanent void mitigation measures, as indicated in Standard Detail 658S-2,\n               generally consist of:\n\n               a.\n\n               Permanent protection of the void by hand packing with 3 to 5-inch (75 to 125 mm) rock\n               to provide stable bearing support and covering the rock at the opening with filter\n               fabric. Low slump concrete (Class I, 3500 psi) will be placed to cover opening area\n               and to seal void at the limits of excavation. Concrete shall be a minimum of 18-inches\n               (457 mm) thick within the void opening and shall extend a minimum of 6 inches (152\n               mm) beyond the edge of the void. Void openings that are less than 30 inches deep shall\n               be sealed entirely with concrete. Place a form to ensure proper placement of low slump\n               concrete-seal over the void opening. After the void is covered, the controlled low-strength\n               bedding and backfill material may be placed. The controlled low-strength fill material\n               shall extend a minimum of 5 feet (1.5 meters) beyond the edge of all voids in all\n               directions.\n\n               b.\n\n               For Grade 2 voids, additional measures may be specified by the engineer (e.g., increase\n               thickness of concrete and placement of rebar reinforcement in the concrete, placement\n               of a steel plate over void opening, etc.).\n\n               3.\n\n               Class III void mitigation measures, as indicated in Standard Detail 658S-3, generally\n               consist of:\n\n               a.\n\n               Permanent protection of the void by hand packing large areas with pea gravel-filled\n               polypropylene bags to provide stable bearing support to protect void from infiltration\n               of backfill material. If void is greater than 100 cubic feet (2.8 cubic meters) or\n               is within a rock strata that is structurally unstable, then 3 to 5-inch (75 to 125\n               mm) rock may be utilized behind the gravel-filled polypropylene bags to prevent ground\n               collapse. A connector pipe may be required to maintain air or water flow within a\n               void bisected by the trench. After the void is filled, place low slump concrete (Class\n               I, 3500 psi) to seal the void opening. If needed, place a form to ensure a minimum\n               thickness of 18 inches (457 mm) into the void.\n\n               b.\n\n               Secondary containment of wastewater and stormsewer lines by installation of carrier\n               pipe or low slump concrete (Class I, 3500 psi) or by CLSM encasement is required.\n               If CLSM encasement is proposed, then the engineer must submit pipe deflection and\n               wall crushing calculations. Encasement by low slump concrete (Class I, 3500 psi) or\n               by CLSM shall be a minimum of 6 inches (152 mm) thickness on all sides of the pipe\n               and shall extend a minimum of 5 feet (1.5 m) beyond the edge of any voids. Design\n               of carrier pipe must be reviewed by the City of Austin for all City of Austin wastewater\n               and stormsewer lines prior to submittal of the site plan correction. Stabilizing collars\n               and other supports, as needed or required, must be provided. The engineer must modify\n               Standard Detail 658S-3 or provide a specific detail showing proposed carrier pipe\n               installation and void mitigation.\n\n               4.\n\n               Class IV void mitigation measures, as indicated in Standard Detail 658S-4, are RESERVED\n               FOR FUTURE RULE REVISION.\n\n               5.\n\n               Class V void mitigation measures, as indicated in Standard Detail 658S-5, generally\n               consist of:\n\n               a.\n\n               Placement of CLSM bedding material along the length of pipe as determined by the Engineer.\n\n               b.\n\n               Placement of gravel backfill material wrapped in PTRM. Limits of gravel backfill material\n               placement shall extend one foot (.305 meters) beyond limits of void in all directions.\n               PTRM shall be placed along areas between the gravel material and trench walls/earth\n               backfill and shall overlap at top.\n\n               c.\n\n               A minimum of 3 feet (.915 meters) of CLSM backfill shall be placed along the length\n               of pipe on either side of the gravel backfill material and shall extend a minimum\n               of 1 foot (.305 meters) above the gravel backfill material. Use forms to control the\n               placement of CLSM material.\n\n               6.\n\n               For Type B and C voids or zones intercepted on one side of a trench; it is anticipated\n               that mitigation measures will consist either of utilizing controlled low strength\n               material (CLSM) for bedding of the pipe and/or backfill of manholes within the area\n               of water flow, or the use of modified concrete retards. The modified Class V permanent\n               void mitigation measures, as indicated in Standard Detail 658S-6, or the Modified\n               Concrete Retard, as shown in Standard Detail 658S-7, shall be followed.\n\n               7.\n\n               Modified Concrete Retards, per Standard Detail 658S-7, or manholes backfilled with\n               CLSM should be placed when water discharge occurs along a rock horizon for a distance\n               of 5 feet (1.5 meters) or more.\n\n               8.\n\n               For Grade 3 voids, the Engineer's specific void mitigation measures will be installed\n               by the Contractor.\n\n               D.\n\n               REPORTING\n\n               1.\n\n               The Geologist or Geologist's Representative shall provide written documentation to\n               the Owner's Representative describing the void and water flow mitigation measures\n               taken on the Project.

A major void is defined as one that has\n               a minor span of more than 10 feet or one that will be compromised by excavation, trenching,\n               or any project activity.\n\n               2)\n\n               An individual detail should be prepared for each major void to clearly explain the\n               strategy specific to that void.\n\n               3)\n\n               The mitigation repair must follow the standard environmental details of City of Austin\n               Standard Details 658S-1 through 658S-7, wherever possible.\n\n               4)\n\n               Representation of the full extent of the known void on a plan view of the project\n               allowing for review of the void with respect to all project elements such as utilities,\n               structure foundations, and roadways.\n\n               5)\n\n               Staff from the affected City of Austin departments (Watershed Protection Department,\n               Austin Water Utility, Public Works Department or others) will review the proposed\n               mitigation repair for environmental, utility, groundwater flow, and structural aspects.\n\n               6)\n\n               Extracted corings and test holes through the void area must be deep enough to show\n               that there are no secondary or underlying voids that may be subject to collapse or\n               damage by the construction of the project or routine use over the life of the facility.\n               Minimum suggested additional depth is 10 feet but a greater depth may be necessary\n               at certain sites.\n\n               7)\n\n               Visual observation of the cave is required to record any environmentally sensitive\n               characteristics, to document evidence of cave roof collapse from construction operations,\n               and to note discontinuous features that may affect the overall stability of the void.\n\n               8)\n\n               If direct observation of the cave cannot occur due to safety reasons, then indirect\n               measurement methods and observations must be utilized. The analysis should be adjusted\n               to provide a greater safety factor to account for conditions that are not detected\n               via indirect measurements and observations.\n\n               9)\n\n               The Engineer(s) must affix their seal to reports, details and site plan correction\n               sheets that are submitted to the City of Austin.\n\n            Environmental\n\n               1)\n\n               Document the presence of water flow features such as cave drips, cave pools, cave\n               streams, cave formations and solution-enlarged fissures or conduits that allow transmittal\n               of water beyond the accessible portion of the cave. Pools, streams or formations may\n               or may not be active at the time of inspection. These are indicators of recharge potential\n               and are to be preserved.\n\n               2)\n\n               Submit a map of the cave footprint that shows all recharge features, springs and voids\n               within a 150-foot radius of the cave footprint. Also show all existing and proposed\n               utilities and infrastructure within a 150-foot radius.\n\n               3)\n\n               For City of Austin Capital Improvement Projects (CIPs) or projects constructed by\n               the City of Austin on behalf of another agency, follow the permitting requirements\n               of the Balcones Canyonlands Conservation Plan Infrastructure program. Contact the\n               Austin Water Utility, Wildlands Conservation Division for guidance and procedures.\n\n            Structural Requirements\n\n               1)\n\n               Testing and reporting on the competency of the rock in terms of strength, rock quality\n               designation (RQD), characterization of the formation, and possibly other soundness\n               parameters such as compressive and tensile strengths and cohesion to estimate shear\n               capacity of the rock is required.\n\n               2)\n\n               Structural analysis of the strength of the compromised void that will remain after\n               all cuts, utility trenches, and excavations are completed with appropriate safety\n               factors.\n\n               3)\n\n               Accurately modeling the structural conditions found in natural voids can be difficult.\n               The thinly bedded nature of some sedimentary rock and slip planes, fissures, and fracturing\n               of that rock often preclude the use of some models such as Voussoir arches. Therefore,\n               a relatively straight forward beam analysis with some degree of fixed end conditions\n               is often the most appropriate approach to determine the capacity of a cave roof in\n               limestone formations. The shape of the cave, such as highly sloped walls, would affect\n               the critical beam length to be analyzed in that case. Pressure arch models and other\n               theories may be appropriate, but must be very carefully considered before use. Recommendation\n               of the final analysis methodology remains with the design engineer. Provide justification\n               for the methodology used, cite the reference document for the methodology, and include\n               all assumptions in the report. The methodology must be approved by the City of Austin\n               in order to approve the void mitigation submittal. The AASHTO LRFD load and resistance\n               factors and load combinations from the current version of the Bridge Design Specifications\n               should be used for voids under roadways.\n\n               4)\n\n               Factor of safety is the allowable strength of the native limestone rock compared to\n               the calculated forces under service load conditions. Due to the relatively large uncertainty\n               in dealing with natural materials, large factors of safety on the order of 4.0 are\n               necessary and preferably much greater factors are desirable.\n\n               5)\n\n               There must be a clear, positive load path in normal concrete or another approved structural\n               material from floor to ceiling to support roof of void shown on shown on details and\n               included on the plans.\n\n               6)\n\n               A normal strength concrete is required for structural \"wall\" elements; however, any\n               approved flowable fill is adequate where a large expanse of a void is being completely\n               filled in.\n\n               7)\n\n               There must be full, positive retention of all unbound materials such as gravel, pea\n               gravel, loose rock, bagged materials, or any other fill materials. For example, formed\n               concrete walls from floor to ceiling would be required to retain a floor to ceiling\n               gravel fill.\n\n            Source: Rule No. R161-14.25, 12-30-2014.",

    "content": "This Section of Environmental Criteria Manual (ECM) is a resource document for the\n            clarification and guidance of the minimum design criteria required to achieve compliant\n            shoreline modification, stabilization and access as per Chapter 25-2, Subchapter C,\n            Article 13 Sections 25-2-1171 through 25-2-1179, and compliant screening requirements\n            for shoreline access as per Section 25-2-1066 of the City of Austin's (COA) Land Development\n            Code (LDC). Requirements are established in subsections 1.13.4, 1.13.6, 1.13.7, and 1.13.8; resource and guidance are provided in subsections 1.13.5 and 1.13.9. These rules apply to the applicable development of the shores, banks and slopes\n            of Lake Austin, Lady Bird Lake and Lake Walter E. Long.\n            \n            As a resource document, subsections 1.13.5 and 1.13.9 provide several methods that, if used in the appropriate setting, should achieve\n            compliant shoreline stabilization while minimizing wave return, promoting ecological\n            function and maintaining the natural and traditional character of the lakeshore. However,\n            these are in no way a complete exhaustive compendium of suitable methods. The specific\n            methods selected by the applicant to satisfy the criteria included in this manual\n            are the sole responsibility of the applicant and should be based on the constraints\n            of the project area.\n            \n            Any questions concerning the guidance or use of methods not included in this document\n            should be directed to the Environmental Resource Management division, Watershed Protection\n            Department. Methods of design other than those indicated in these rules may be considered\n            in those cases where experience indicates they are appropriate. However, any variations\n            from the methods established in these rules must have the express written approval\n            of the Director of the Watershed Protection Department or the Director's designee.\n            \n            Naturally vegetated and sloping shorelines provide ecosystem benefits including soil\n            stabilization, wave abatement, pollutant removal, and habitat. Native riparian plants\n            have both structural and physiological adaptations (Mitsch 1993) which stabilize the\n            soils with extensive root systems that can increase the shear strength of soil by\n            transferring shear stresses into tensile resistance (Gray and Sotir 1996). The increase\n            in structural habitat complexity (which includes the roots, plant bodies and irregular\n            surfaces of natural shorelines) results in an increase in dissipation of the kinetic\n            energy of waves (Gabel et al. 2008). Wetlands are able to remove excess nutrients\n            from the water, including nitrogen, phosphorus and organic carbon (National Research\n            Council 1995), immobilize and remove toxins, such as heavy metals, including copper,\n            lead and zinc (Hammer 1989) and reduce turbidity (Kahl 1993; Vestergaard and Sand-Jensen\n            2000). The surfaces of organic inputs from riparian plants in addition to the stems,\n            leaves, and roots of wetland plants are colonized by microscopic life (Dodds 2002)\n            which are the principal food source of many invertebrates (Baker and Orr 1986). This\n            community establishes the foundation of a complex food web that fosters a healthy\n            biological community. Vegetated and structurally complex shallow waters are utilized\n            by juvenile fish as protective nurseries which provide shelter from predators and\n            safe havens for foraging (Wiley et al. 1984; Killgore et al. 1989).\n            \n            Although some degree of shoreline erosion is a natural process that sustains riparian\n            ecology, accelerated erosion due to man-made influences can result in property loss\n            and degradation of aquatic and terrestrial resources. These influences include, but\n            are not limited to, increased wave action from recreational boating, removal of native\n            shoreline vegetation and physical modification of the shoreline. The traditional approach\n            to stabilize a shoreline has been to armor the bank with a vertical bulkhead. These\n            rigid, vertical structures inhibit the potential benefits of natural shorelines and\n            can create additional problems including the reflection of wave energy and increased\n            wave action (Gabel et al. 2008), increased erosion of the lake bed (Herder 2007),\n            increased turbidity (NOAA 2007), degradation of aquatic habitat (Engle and Pederson\n            1998), and removal of shoreline vegetation which can affect the productivity of aquatic\n            biological communities (Kahler, Grassley and Beauchamp 2000). Although individual\n            small changes to the environment may not significantly impact an ecosystem, the \"cumulative\n            effects of even small lakeshore alterations can lead to major ecosystem responses\"\n            (Burns 1991). The findings of the first National Lakes Assessment (NLA) conducted\n            by the EPA indicate that \"poor habitat condition along the lakeshore is the most significant\n            stressor in lakes.\" The NLA suggests that local initiatives \"should center on protecting\n            shorelines habitats, particularly maintaining vegetative cover\" (USEPA 2010).",

    "content": "A.\n            \n            Purpose and Intent.\n            \n            Several recent studies have indicated a need to address both the results of wave action\n            and protection of shoreline integrity. In 2005, following observations of wave action\n            on various shorelines of Lake Austin, the Lake Austin Advisory Panel of the Lower\n            Colorado River Authority (LCRA) recommended the disapproval of vertical, flat bulkheads\n            unless several features were incorporated for the minimization of wave return. A report\n            of recreational boating on Lake Austin by the LCRA, City of Austin and Texas A&amp;M AgriLife\n            has documented significant public concern about the negative effects of wave action\n            on Lake Austin (Kyle et al. 2009). The first National Lakes Assessment (NLA) by the\n            U.S.EPA has stressed the contribution to water quality and biological integrity of\n            naturally functioning shorelines (USEPA 2010). In 2009 the City of Austin Parks Board,\n            Environmental Board and Planning Commission supported an initiative to amend the code\n            and criteria for the \"prevention of vertical bulkheads and promotion of stable shorelines\n            with materials and designs that provide the environmental function of native riparian\n            vegetation and shoreline geomorphology.\" On December 9, 2010, the City Council approved\n            amendments supporting the recommendations of the boards and commissions (Ordinance\n            Number 20101209-075). The amendments became effective on December 20, 2010.\n            \n            In order to protect public safety, property, water quality and ecosystem integrity,\n            the intent of these rules is to provide criteria and guidance for code compliant shoreline\n            development that promote the form, function and benefits of natural riparian ecosystems.\n            The objectives include providing examples of shoreline stabilization methods which\n            minimize wave return by protecting and/or establishing vegetated, sloping shorelines,\n            and identifying methods to protect the integrity of steep slopes with native vegetation.\n            \n            B.\n            \n            Plans and Computations.\n            \n            Plans and computations to support all shoreline modification and access designs shall\n            be submitted to the Planning and Development Review Department for review. The Staff\n            review period for preliminary plan approval is described in LDC \u00a7 25-4-56. Plans and\n            computations shall be in such form as to allow for timely and consistent review and\n            to be made a part of the permanent record for future reference. The reviewer may deny\n            an application if the applicant cannot support designs with appropriate calculations.\n            All engineering computations shall be certified by a Professional Engineer licensed\n            in the State of Texas.",

The landward boundary of this zone is ten feet inland horizontally from the shoreline.\n            The lakeward boundary of this zone extends to the topographic contour of one foot\n            in depth vertically from the normal pool elevation. See Figure 1.13-1a.\n            \n            Scour Depth - Depth at which hydrodynamic bottom shear stresses are greater than sediment critical\n            shear stress resulting in scour, or removal of granular bed material by hydrodynamic\n            forces.\n            \n            Significant Wave Height - Average wave height for the highest one-third of waves for a specified period of\n            time (USDA, 1983). A reasonable assumption for shorelines that face the centerline\n            of Lake Austin is 1.5 feet. See Figure 1.13-1b.\n            \n            Toe - The break in slope at the foot, or bottom of a bank, where it meets the lakebed.\n            \n            Toe Protection - Submerged materials that are sized to resist movement and/or erosion of lakebed\n            by hydrodynamic forces such as wave action.\n            \n            Wave Action Zone - The zone that extends from the depth at which wave-induced water movement is negligible\n            (1/2 wavelength) to the landward extent of the height of wave run-up. A reasonable\n            assumption for the depth at which water movement is negligible for shorelines that\n            face the centerline of Lake Austin is a depth of four feet. See Figure 1.13-1b.\n            \n            Wave Height - Wave height is the vertical distance measured from trough to crest (USDA, 1983).\n            Observations of the LCRA Lake Austin Advisory Panel on Lake Austin indicate that a\n            reasonable assumption for wave height is 1.5 feet (Crowther, personal communication,\n            September 2, 2005). See Figure 1.13-1b.\n            \n            Wavelength - The horizontal distance between similar points on two successive waves measured\n            perpendicularly to the crest (USDA, 1997). Observations of the LCRA Lake Austin Advisory\n            Panel on Lake Austin indicate that a reasonable assumption for wavelength is 12 feet\n            (Crowther, personal communication, September 2, 2005). See Figure 1.13-1b.\n            \n            Wave Run-up - The vertical distance above the normal pool elevation (as defined in LDC 25-2-1172)\n            that a wave will run up the slope of a shore as it dissipates its energy. The USDA\n            Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) provides technical guidance for calculating\n            wave run-up in Slope Protection for Dams and Lakeshores (USDA, 1997).

The scope of the project should be evaluated in the context of LDC\n            25-7-62 to determine if the site plan is required to be accompanied by a certificate\n            bearing the seal of a Texas professional engineer.\n            \n            An evaluation of existing site characteristics should be performed prior to determining\n            the appropriate method for shoreline stabilization. These characteristics include\n            surface runoff, near-shore bathymetry, site topography, soil composition, vegetation,\n            wave run up, hydrology and slope stability. It is recommended that selection of the\n            appropriate method that meets the intent of this section should be determined by a\n            licensed engineer.\n            \n            Selection of appropriate methods for shoreline stabilization should consider the following\n            factors:\n            \n            \u2022\u2002Soil characteristics of banks and bed of shoreline.\n            \n            \u2022\u2002Proximity to and constraints of Critical Environmental Features (CEF's) such as\n            wetlands, springs, caves, rimrocks and bluffs.\n            \n            \u2022\u2002Existing lakeshore morphology.\n            \n            \u2022\u2002Potential access related to construction or future repair or maintenance of the\n            structure.\n            \n            \u2022\u2002Minimizing impacts to riparian vegetation and/or fish and wildlife habitat.\n            \n            \u2022\u2002Erosion dynamics of the shoreline (i.e., what is causing the problem).\n            \n            \u2022\u2002Appropriate temporary and permanent erosion and sedimentation controls.\n            \n            \u2022\u2002Location along the lake (i.e., is the location in a low or high energy environment).\n            \n            In the case of shoreline stabilization and modification, work should only be undertaken\n            when the need for such work can be justified by the level of risk to existing buildings,\n            roads, services or property that are being threatened by erosion. Shoreline stabilization\n            methods include non-structural, hybrid and structural. The shoreline stabilization\n            method should be appropriate for the conditions of the site.

They can also be used in conjunction\n               with hybrid or structural methods described below for portions of projects above the\n               wave runup elevation. Non-structural methods are primarily a combination of native\n               and adapted vegetation with natural, biodegradable materials, generally including\n               coconut fiber rolls, wattles, and /or mattresses, but can also include live fascines,\n               live stakes, branch packing, live cribwalls, joint plantings, and brush mattresses\n               as described in part 650 of the Engineering Field Handbook (USDA, 1996) and Part 654\n               of the National Engineering Handbook (USDA 2007). Examples of non-structural methods\n               are included in Section 1.13.9.\n\n               Shoreline stabilization strategies are preferred that utilize native vegetation and\n               biodegradable materials to enhance the integrity of the shoreline and do not concurrently\n               alter the shoreline, remove existing native vegetation, disturb soils, involve the\n               placement of fill in the lake, hard-armor the shoreline, or otherwise constitute development\n               as defined by LDC 25-1-21. Activities that meet these constraints may not require\n               a site plan as per LDC 25-5-1, and are encouraged if sustainable. First consideration\n               should be given to the appropriateness of these non-structural stabilization methods\n               for any shoreline stabilization project.\n\n               2.\n\n               Hybrid Methods.\n\n               If site conditions do not permit the exclusive use of non-structural methods, then\n               a hybrid method should be used for shoreline stabilization including bioengineered\n               or biotechnical stabilization methods. Hybrid methods use soft armor materials such\n               as vegetated, fabric encapsulated soil (FES) lifts above the wave runup height and\n               hard armored materials such as appropriately-sized rock riprap in the wave action\n               zone. Hybrid methods also include vegetated, graded slope with rock riprap toe protection\n               and FES lifts with a stacked limestone boulder toe protection. Figures illustrating\n               various hybrid methodologies are included in Section 1.13.9.\n\n               Structural components such as pilings, concrete and metal sheet piles may constitute\n               portions of the internal components of the hybrid structure but not external portions\n               as per the examples in Section 1.13.9. Native and adapted vegetation plantings are incorporated into the stabilization\n               strategy to be located within in the boundaries of the Lakeshore Vegetation Buffer\n               Zone as per the requirements of ECM Section 1.13.6(C).\n\n               3.\n\n               Structural Methods.\n\n               If site conditions present extreme characteristics, such as vertical bathymetry or\n               man-made channels, purely structural methods may be approved if they meet the general\n               requirements of this section. Structural methods include metal sheet piles as internal\n               components of a bulkhead and rock walls as external components. The exclusive use\n               of structural methods is discouraged unless dictated by extreme site constraints.\n               Structural methods must still demonstrate compliance with the design and materials\n               described in this section. Structural methods will require native and adapted vegetation\n               plantings in the Lakeshore Vegetation Buffer Zone as per the requirements of ECM Section\n               1.13.6(C) to maintain the natural and traditional character of the waterway.\n\n               C.\n\n               Selection Limitations.\n\n               The methods appropriate for high energy environments such as structural hard armoring\n               may not be appropriate for use in low energy environments or within the boundaries\n               of CEF's, unless the applicant can demonstrate and submit calculations supporting\n               a reasonable and appropriate need for such methods. First consideration must be given\n               to non-structural methods. If non-structural and hybrid methods are not proposed,\n               the applicant must demonstrate that site conditions present extreme circumstances\n               commensurate with structural methods. Extreme circumstances include, but are not limited\n               to, steeply descending slopes below the normal high water mark which result in depths\n               that would otherwise result in the potential discharge of greater than an average\n               of one cubic yard of fill per running foot along the bank below the plane of the ordinary\n               high water mark.",

    "content": "As per LDC 25-2-1174(C) a retaining wall, bulkhead, or other erosion protection device\n            must be constructed using design and materials prescribed by rule. The following design\n            and material criteria have been developed with the purpose and intent of the promotion\n            of non-vertical, stable shorelines that provide wave abatement as well as provide\n            the environmental function of native riparian vegetation and shoreline geomorphology.\n            Retaining walls, bulkheads and other erosion protection devices that do not exclusively\n            utilize a non-structural method as described in 1.13.5(A)(1) must demonstrate the following design and material criteria:\n\n               A.\n\n               Non-Vertical Slope.\n\n               The shoreline stabilization method shall not exhibit vertical slopes steeper than\n               1H:1V (45 degrees) in the wave action zone for any portion greater than one foot in\n               height. As per LDC 25-2-1174, this requirement does not apply to existing man-made\n               channels. For the purposes of this section only, man-made channels are those areas\n               which were wholly and completely uplands prior to excavation for navigational purposes,\n               but do not include areas which were expansions or excavations of pre-existing wetlands\n               or waterways.\n\n               B.\n\n               Protection From Overtopping, Toe Scour and Flanking.\n\n               The shoreline stabilization method shall not inherently cause erosion of the upper\n               bank, lakebed or adjacent shoreline. A more thorough explanation of overtopping, toe\n               scour and flanking with design considerations and figures is provided in Slope Protection\n               for Dams and Lakeshores (USDA 1997).\n\n               1.\n\n               Overtopping - The shoreline stabilization method provides overtop protection to the maximum extent\n               of wave runup on the upper bank. Wave runup can be reduced by using a cap that extends\n               from the top of the bulkhead or by providing a layer of stable horizontal or sloped\n               materials on which wave run-up can be dissipated.\n\n               2.\n\n               Toe Scour Protection - The shoreline stabilization method must provide toe protection of the slope which\n               is embedded to a depth that is greater than the maximum scour depth of the lake bed\n               calculated based on site specific characteristics.\n\n               3.\n\n               Flanking - The shoreline stabilization method must provide protection of the adjacent shoreline\n               from flanking by demonstrating that the ends of the structure resist erosion with\n               tiebacks or return walls.\n\n               C.\n\n               Vegetation Plantings for Wave Abatement and Stabilization.\n\n               Riparian vegetation plantings as per the criteria within this subsection are required\n               for shoreline modification and/or shoreline stabilization as part of the comprehensive\n               design and materials for shoreline stabilization and/or wave abatement. Native and\n               adapted emergent wetland plants provide wave abatement, shade and cover for fish,\n               microhabitats for invertebrates, stabilization of the soft bottom sediments and sequestration\n               of pollutants. Riparian vegetation of the lower and upper banks provide soil stabilization,\n               erosion protection from overland flow, nutrient removal, shading and organic inputs\n               for aquatic life. Together, the aquatic and riparian vegetation perform critical functions\n               in the stability and ecological function of the lakeshore. To maximize the success\n               of vegetation plantings, it is recommended that the applicant consult a landscape\n               architect or similar professional specializing in wetland plants to determine site-specific\n               considerations including location, planting method, temporary irrigation or temporary\n               protection from wave action. In addition, shoreline stabilization measures should\n               maintain existing shoreline vegetation to the maximum extent practicable and provide\n               1:1 mitigation for unavoidable loss of herbaceous and woody vegetation. The applicant\n               must demonstrate the posting of fiscal surety for revegetation as part of the permanent\n               erosion and sedimentation control strategy.\n\n               The plants in Table 1.13-2 include an assortment of native and adapted riparian species\n               from which a selection can be made to offset any difficulty in acquiring any particular\n               specie due to variability in commercial availability. The vegetation specifications\n               of a site plan proposing shoreline modification or stabilization must:\n\n               1.\n\n               Incorporate the planting of mature specimens of riparian, native and adapted vegetation\n               and identify the quantity, size, species and location of all plantings in the site\n               plan. Approved species are listed in Table 1.13-2, however, alternative native and\n               adapted species can be approved by the PDR Environmental Reviewer, ERM Wetland Biologist\n               or ERM Landscape Architect. Plantings shall be located within the Lakeshore Vegetation\n               Buffer Zone as defined in Section 1.13.3.\n\n               2.\n\n               Demonstrate the appropriate quantities of plantings commensurate with shoreline modification\n               and extent of impact. The exclusive use of non-structural methods (as per Section\n               1.13.5) exempts the applicant from quantity requirements, however, recommended quantity\n               is 1gallon containers on three foot centers. Minimum required planting quantities\n               for Hybrid methods (as per Section 1.13.5) shall be either one plant (of 1-gallon containerized or equivalent) per 20 square\n               feet of LOC or one plant (of 1-gallon containerized or equivalent) per 3 running feet\n               of shoreline modified. Planting quantities for Structural methods (as per Section\n               1.13.5) shall be two plants (of 1-gallon containerized or equivalent) per 20 square feet\n               of LOC or two plants (of 1-gallon containerized or equivalent) per 3 running feet\n               of shoreline modified. Equivalency ratios are as follows:\n\n               \u2022\u2002One 1-gallon container = two 1-quart size.\n\n               \u2022\u2002One 1-quart size = one 4-inch container.\n\n               \u2022\u2002One 4-inch size = four bare root specimens.\n\n               3.\n\n               Specify that plants do not include invasive species and be sourced from within a 200\n               mile radius of Austin.\n\n               4.\n\n               Achieve a minimum diversity of 3 species required for projects impacting less than\n               100 linear feet of shoreline, and a minimum of 5 species required for larger projects.\n\n               5.\n\n               Demonstrate utilization of approved species as per Table 1.13-2 or documentation of\n               approval of alternative native and adapted species as approved by the PDR Environmental\n               Reviewer, ERM wetland biologist or ERM landscape architect.\n\n            Table 1.13-2 Shoreline vegetation

sand, plants and/or bioengineered textiles that support the growth\n               of vegetation) that preserve the natural and traditional character of the waterway\n               (see LDC 25-7-61(A)(5)(b)) and minimize damage to the physical and biological characteristics\n               (see ECM 1.7.7(A)). Internal structural components may include non-natural materials\n               such as concrete and/or corrosion resistant steel and aluminum pilings, metal sheet\n               piles, anchors and fasteners as necessary. Materials approved for the external components\n               include:\n\n               1.\n\n               Rock Riprap. Riprap is a layer, facing or protective mound of stone strategically\n               placed to protect the shoreline from erosion. Rock riprap conforming to Standard Specification\n               Item No. 591S, \"Riprap for Slope Protection\" for dry riprap, may be used for bank\n               protection. When the riprap will be placed on an erodible soil, as determined by the\n               Engineer or designated representative, a layer of filter fabric or granular filter\n               material shall be placed, prior to placement of the Riprap material. Filter fabric\n               conforming to Standard Specification Item No. 620S, \"Filter Fabric\", may be used for\n               bank protection. Rock Riprap shall be of sufficient size(s), layer thickness, gradation,\n               vertical extent and slope to demonstrate stability under expected conditions. Riprap\n               on a shoreline shall be sized appropriately for the weight, specific gravity and slope\n               for a given wave height according to the Rock Size Selection method in Figure 1.13-2\n               (see also USDA 1983). Additional guidance for riprap in lake and stream environments\n               is provided in Slope Protection for Dams and Lakeshores (USDA 1997), Design of Coastal\n               Revetments, Seawalls and Bulkheads (USCOE 1995), Bridge Scour and Stream Instability\n               Countermeasures: Experience, Selection, and Design Guidance (Federal Highway Administration\n               2009), ECM Section 1.4.6, Design of Riprap Revetments (Federal Highway Administration 1989), Riprap Design\n               Criteria, Recommended Specifications and Quality Control (NCHRP 2006), and Loose Riprap\n               Protection (USDA 1989).\n\n               Figure 1.13-2.

SRB conforming to Standard Specification Item No. 605S,\n               \"Soil Retention Blanket\", may be used for bank protection.\n\n               3.\n\n               Coconut (Coir) Fiber rolls and mattresses. Coconut rolls and mattresses shall be manufactured\n               from 100 percent mattress grade, non-sorted coconut fiber and encased in 100 percent\n               coconut fiber mesh netting. Fiber interior of rolls shall be tightly packed into the\n               mesh and have a minimum density of 7 pounds per cubic foot. Mesh shall have approximately\n               2 inch rhombic or square mesh openings with mesh junctions tied. Tensile strength\n               per hand or machine yarn shall be 90 pounds when dry. Each coconut roll shall have\n               a minimum diameter equal to 12 inches. Coconut fiber rolls and mattresses should be\n               installed and anchored as per manufacturer specifications for site specific conditions.\n\n               4.\n\n               Structural Geogrids. Structural geogrids shall consist of a regular network of integrally\n               connected tensile elements with apertures of sufficient size to allow interlocking\n               with surrounding soil, rock or earth and function primarily as reinforcement.

These rules apply to all land located within the\n            city limits and to those projects outside the city limits which have agreed to comply\n            with these provisions as part of a contractual agreement with the City.

Undisturbed natural areas\n            and undisturbed existing trees can also be counted toward the 50% requirement as long\n            as no potable irrigation is installed. Section 2.4.9 of this manual explains the requirements of the ordinance and provides guidance on\n            methods of compliance.\n            \n            The site plan approval process is outlined in Chapter 25-5 of the LDC. Procedures\n            for inspection and enforcement are also found in 25-1.\n            \n            Appeals concerning the enforcement of these rules shall be brought to the Director\n            of the Planning and Development Review Department.",

The requirement for impermeable barriers\n               will be at the discretion of the design engineer.\n\n               Landscaped areas receiving stormwater runoff that are adjacent to vehicular use areas\n               must be protected by concrete curbs or equivalent barriers in compliance with 2.4.7 of this manual.\n\n               Landscaped areas receiving stormwater runoff should be designed to avoid the extended\n               ponding of stagnant water in accordance with Section 10-5-21 of the Austin City Code.\n               Landscaped areas designed as water quality controls will have to demonstrate a specific\n               drawdown time in accordance with Section 1.6 of this manual.\n\n               B.\n\n               Drainage Areas.\n\n               The drainage area used to irrigate landscaping with stormwater must be calculated\n               to provide sufficient water for the landscaped area. To achieve this standard, the\n               minimum drainage area for landscaped areas receiving stormwater runoff shall be a\n               ratio of 1 square foot of drainage to 2 square feet of landscaped area. For example,\n               a landscaped area of 100 square feet would require a minimum of 50 square feet of\n               drainage area. (A larger drainage area than a 1:2 ratio is encouraged-since it would\n               generate more runoff for irrigation-but is not required.)\n\n               The maximum drainage area for landscaped areas receiving stormwater runoff is only\n               limited by the need to maintain non-erosive flows or by requirements of Section 1.6\n               of this manual if the landscaped area is also being designed as a water quality control.\n               The project engineer shall ensure that maximum projected flows and velocities are\n               below erosive values for the particular soil conditions of landscaped areas receiving\n               stormwater runoff.\n\n               To demonstrate sufficient water for the landscaped area, as defined above, the site\n               plan must show the drainage area(s) used to irrigate landscaping with stormwater,\n               including notation of the size of each drainage area and the size of each landscaped\n               area irrigated with stormwater. This information should be included as part of the\n               landscape plan section of the site plan. See below for an example of this notation.\n\n               The site plan must also include notation of the land uses on impervious areas within\n               the drainage area(s). Land uses that may generate highly contaminated runoff (see\n               Section D below for more detail) are not allowed within drainage areas unless the\n               landscaped area is designed as a water quality control. These uses/activities are\n               more specific (e.g., trash compactor areas, vehicle washing areas) than general land\n               use groups (e.g., retail, office) and should be shown on the site plan in relation\n               to the drainage area(s).

However, rainwater\n               harvesting does not have to be designed as a water quality control to comply with\n               this section.\n\n               C.\n\n               Landscaping Adjacent to Pedestrian Areas.\n\n               Landscaped areas that are depressed below grade within the area of influence of pedestrian\n               areas should have a maximum side slope no steeper than three (3) horizontal to one\n               (1) vertical with a height not exceeding one (1) foot. The \"area of influence\" shall\n               be defined as parking lot medians, peninsulas, and islands as well as the five-foot\n               (5') strip of area parallel and adjacent to sidewalks on either or both sides, if\n               applicable. If any portion of the area of influence will include side slopes steeper\n               than three (3) horizontal to one (1) vertical with a height exceeding one (1) foot,\n               then a barrier such as a curb, wall, or railing should be provided.\n\n               D.\n\n               Highly Contaminated Runoff.\n\n               Unless the landscaped area is designed as a water quality control, the drainage area\n               used to irrigate landscaping with stormwater may not include impervious areas on which\n               the land use or activities may generate highly contaminated runoff. These land uses\n               and activities include commercial nurseries, auto salvage facilities, hazardous materials\n               generators (if containers are exposed to rainfall), vehicle fueling and maintenance\n               areas, vehicle and equipment washing and steam or dry cleaning facilities, and food\n               production/distribution loading dock and trash compactor areas. Note: Some of these\n               land uses/activities may have additional discharge restrictions under Chapter 6-5,\n               Article 5 (Discharges into Storm Sewers or Watercourses) of the City Code.\n\n               Sites containing one or more of these land uses or activities can still comply with\n               the requirements of the ordinance by using the following options:\n\n               1.\n\n               Use runoff from areas of the parking lot that do not include these land uses and activities\n               (e.g., fueling area of service station graded to drain to a hazardous materials interceptor\n               - other areas of the parking lot can still drain to landscaping).\n\n               2.\n\n               Use runoff from the roof of the building (e.g., disconnected downspouts or rainwater\n               harvesting system).\n\n               3.\n\n               Design the landscaped area as a water quality control (e.g., rain garden).\n\n               4.\n\n               Leave natural areas and/or existing trees undisturbed.\n\n               E.\n\n               Edwards Aquifer Recharge Zone.\n\n               Unless the landscaped area is designed as a water quality control (or the irrigation\n               area for a water quality control), the drainage area used to irrigate landscaping\n               with stormwater may not include impervious areas used for parking or driving of vehicles\n               if located within the Edwards Aquifer Recharge Zone.\n\n               Except for a vegetative filter strip, landscaped areas designed as water quality controls\n               over the Edwards Aquifer Recharge Zone are required to have an impermeable liner (see\n               1.6.2.C of this manual). However, landscaped areas receiving stormwater runoff that\n               are not designed as water quality controls do not require an impermeable liner since\n               no significant ponding of stormwater occurs.\n\n               Sites located over the Edwards Aquifer Recharge Zone can still comply with the requirements\n               of the ordinance by using the following options:\n\n               1.\n\n               Use runoff from the roof of the building (e.g., disconnected downspouts or rainwater\n               harvesting system).\n\n               2.\n\n               Design the landscaped area as a water quality control (e.g., rain garden, vegetative\n               filter strip, or irrigation area for retention-irrigation pond).\n\n               3.\n\n               Leave natural areas and/or existing trees undisturbed.",

An applicant for a variance must demonstrate that:\n\n               1.\n\n               Strict compliance is infeasible due to unique site conditions including but not limited\n               to topography, size, shape, and location of existing features such as trees or previous\n               development; and\n\n               2.\n\n               The proposed nature and location of irrigation is the minimal departure from the requirements.\n\n            The applicant should demonstrate one of the following:\n\n               1.\n\n               Greater than 50% of the landscaped area is located upgrade from the impervious cover\n               on the site and would require a mechanical pump system or significant cut and fill\n               in order to irrigate using stormwater. For example: redevelopment projects with existing\n               grading and landscaping or a site sloping down from a road with the majority of the\n               street yard located up at the top of the site.\n\n               2.\n\n               The site does not have enough available impervious cover to irrigate 50% of the required\n               landscaped area. For example: sites where use of stormwater runoff from certain areas\n               is restricted (land uses with highly contaminated runoff or pavement over the Recharge\n               Zone).\n\n               3.\n\n               Other unique site conditions exist that make strict compliance infeasible.\n\n            If the site cannot irrigate an area equivalent to 50% of the required landscaped area\n            or protect an equivalent area of undisturbed natural area or undisturbed existing\n            trees, then the applicant must demonstrate that the proposed nature and location of\n            irrigation for the site is the minimal departure from the requirements.",

    "content": "Section 25-2-1001 of the Land Development Code provides authority for the Director\n            of the Planning and Development Review Department to accept alternative designs, which\n            prove to be as good or better than strict compliance with the basic landscape requirements.\n            \n            Alternative proposals should be clearly identified on the landscape plans and the\n            site plan application should include a letter outlining the alternative proposal.\n            (see Appendix E). Review of the alternative proposal will be in conjunction with the\n            site plan review.\n            \n            To establish some guideline equivalents for the major landscape requirements listed\n            in Section 2.4.0, a list of alternative equivalent ratings are found below. These ratings assign relative\n            values to the landscape elements of a design and should be used when formulating alternative\n            proposals. Each basic requirement that cannot be achieved is assigned a negative point\n            value and may be compensated for with positive equivalents shown in the compensation\n            list. An example using this concept is provided in Figure 2-7 in Appendix V of this\n            manual.\n            \n            These ratings are intended to provide guidance for proposing alternatives to strict\n            compliance for unusual site-specific conditions.

The\n            extent of the natural area to be preserved will be delineated on plan by the construction\n            limit line. The square footage (along with percentages) of the required and actual\n            natural area of the site to be kept must be noted in the calculations (see Appendix\n            B).\n            \n            2.\n            \n            Nondeveloped Areas.\n            \n            All areas of the site which have not been developed (prior to the effective date of\n            the code provisions or preceding ordinances) may count toward this requirement. This\n            would allow areas previously cleared for ranching, farming, for lawns or gardening,\n            to be counted as natural areas. However, these areas must be seeded with native grasses\n            and wildflowers and allowed to revegetate to a natural condition (see Appendix A for\n            specific restoration criteria). The establishment of a mix of woody plants within\n            these areas by the planting of seeds or seedlings will lessen the time required for\n            natural restoration and is strongly encouraged.\n            \n            3.\n            \n            Previously Developed Areas.\n            \n            Areas of the site which have been developed (prior to the effective date of the ordinance\n            or preceding ordinances) may be used to count toward this requirement if the areas\n            are substantially revegetated with native trees, shrubs and grasses, according to\n            restoration criteria (see Appendix A). Such restored areas must be noted within the\n            Hill Country calculations. Show location, size and species of these plants on all\n            landscape working plans. The determination of density requirements for trees and shrubs\n            (high, medium or low) will be verified by the Planning and Development Review Department\n            after analysis of the existing natural vegetation remaining on the site or on nearby\n            sites.\n            \n            4.\n            \n            Preservation Priority.\n            \n            In all cases, priority should be given to the preservation of areas existing in a\n            natural state rather than the restoration of disturbed areas.\n            \n            5.\n            \n            Location of Natural Areas.\n            \n            All natural areas, in order to be counted toward the 40 percent requirement, must\n            be outside the proposed construction limit line. Placement of this line (even within\n            medians or the highway buffer) is subject to all criteria outlined in Section 2.7.2 F, \"Protection of Natural Areas.\"\n            \n            6.\n            \n            Departure from Requirement.\n            \n            Any departure from the 40 percent area requirement would require a waiver, which must\n            be approved by the Planning Commission and City Council. The evaluation of waiver\n            requests will be based on the adherence to the waiver provisions of the Code, especially\n            those related to environmental protection and aesthetic enhancement.\n            \n            7.\n            \n            Sewage Disposal Fields.\n            \n            No more than a quarter of the total required natural area (40 percent of the site)\n            can be disturbed in any way to install sewage disposal fields (wastewater drainfields).\n            \n            Disturbance would include the maximum area required for the field itself plus any\n            adjacent area which needs to be disturbed in any way for construction access, utility\n            line access or other installation requirements.\n            \n            8.\n            \n            Revegetation of Sewage Disposal Fields.\n            \n            Revegetation of disposal field areas must be done according to the restoration criteria\n            in Appendix A. Show location, size and species of these plants on all landscape working\n            plans. The determination of density requirements for trees and shrubs (high, medium\n            or low) will be verified by the Planning and Development Review Department after analysis\n            of the natural vegetation existing on the site.\n            \n            Placement of sewage disposal fields within the natural area should achieve the following\n            objectives (in descending order of importance):\n            \n            \u2022\u2002Minimum encroachment on natural critical areas.\n            \n            \u2022\u2002Minimum removal of surveyed trees.\n            \n            \u2022\u2002Suitability for engineering needs. (For example, when a certain area is the only\n            location for a disposal field.)\n            \n            \u2022\u2002Placement where least visible from adjacent roadways.\n            \n            C.\n            \n            Highway Vegetative Buffer.\n            \n            1.\n            \n            Buffer Quantity and Quality\n            \n            The buffer area will be 100 feet in depth (as measured from the property line adjacent\n            to the right of way) along the entire Hill Country roadway frontage. For smaller sites,\n            (where this 100 foot strip would be more than 20 percent of the site), the vegetative\n            buffer can be reduced equal to 20 percent of the square footage of the property.\n            \n            This buffer should in general extend the same distance back from the right of way,\n            along the entire roadway frontage, unless other factors (such as preserving a natural\n            critical area) require it to be different. In such a case the departure should be\n            the minimum necessary.\n            \n            The required setback (whether 100 feet or another number) must be clearly shown on\n            plan and the square footage of the buffer strip must be noted in the calculations.\n            \n            2.\n            \n            Drives and Utilities in Buffer.\n            \n            Only driveways and utilities which provide direct vehicular access or utility service\n            to a specific project. Removal of any woody vegetation in the highway buffer, except\n            to allow for direct vehicular access or utility service, detention/sedimentation ponds\n            or wastewater drainfields requires a waiver from the City Code provisions.\n            \n            Clearing of grasses or forbs only will not require a waiver, provided that the area\n            disturbed is completely restored with native grasses and wildflowers according to\n            the restoration criteria in Appendix A. Show the areas to be seeded and note the species\n            and rates of application on all landscape working plans.\n            \n            3.\n            \n            Berm Signs in Buffer.\n            \n            Berm or monument signs may be placed in the highway buffer, but only in areas where\n            existing native vegetation will not be impacted. In general, they should be located\n            in areas which are otherwise required to be disturbed (such as adjacent to entry drives)\n            and should be indicated on plans as being within the limit of construction.\n            \n            4.\n            \n            Buffer Right of Way Boundaries.\n            \n            The determination of the boundaries of the highway buffer and required natural area\n            shall be based on the dedicated right of way or the right of way reserved based on\n            Section 25-6-55 of the LDC. Any dedication of right of way after the site plan has\n            been approved and released will not affect previously determined calculations for\n            highway buffer and for natural area. Future right of way lines (not required to be\n            dedicated or purchased prior to release of site plan) should not be used in determining\n            highway buffer or required natural area.\n            \n            5.\n            \n            Disturbance of Vegetation in Highway Buffer.\n            \n            \u2022\u2002Any development which has previously occurred in the highway buffer will be considered\n            substantial disturbance.\n            \n            \u2022\u2002Revegetation of these areas should be done according to the restoration criteria\n            in Appendix A. Show location, size and species of these plants on all landscape plans.\n            The determination of density requirements for trees and shrubs (high, medium or low)\n            will be verified by the Department of Environmental Protection, after analysis of\n            the existing natural vegetation remaining on the site or on nearby sites.\n            \n            \u2022\u2002Development does not include ranching; therefore if land has been cleared in the\n            past for this purpose and is not subsequently disturbed, it will not need full revegetation\n            with trees and shrubs. (The same standard will apply if land has been previously cleared\n            for farming, lawns or gardening.) However, these areas must be seeded with native\n            grasses and wildflowers and allowed to revegetate to a natural condition (see Appendix\n            A for specific restoration criteria). The establishment of a mix of woody plants within\n            these areas by the planting of seeds or seedlings will lessen the time required for\n            natural restoration and is strongly encouraged.\n            \n            \u2022\u2002Only those areas within the highway vegetative buffer which have previously been\n            substantially disturbed can be used for ponds and drainfields. For this provision\n            only, substantial disturbance will include not only development but also any area\n            which has been substantially cleared (where nearly all the native vegetation has been\n            removed) and kept cleared prior to the effective date of the ordinance or preceding\n            ordinances. For example, a piece of land which has been cleared of all vegetation\n            except a few trees, for use as pasture, would fit this definition.\n            \n            \u2022\u2002Use of these areas will be limited only to wastewater drainfields (sewage disposal\n            fields) detention/sedimentation ponds. No sedimentation/filtration ponds will be allowed\n            under this provision.\n            \n            \u2022\u2002No more than \u00bd of the buffer area can be disturbed (including land disturbed for\n            access drives and utilities) in order to install ponds or drainfields. Disturbance\n            would include not only the actual minimum area required for the pond or drainfield\n            but also any adjacent area which is needed for construction access or utility line\n            access or otherwise needs to be accessed to feasibly allow installation.\n            \n            \u2022\u2002Such areas must be clearly delineated on plan. Within each area, note the actual\n            square footage of the pond or field itself. On the Hill Country calculation list note\n            the total square footage of the highway buffer to be used for installation of ponds\n            or drainfields; also note the total square footage of the highway buffer used for\n            access and utilities.\n            \n            \u2022\u2002Revegetation of pond and drainfield areas should be done according to restoration\n            criteria in Appendix A. Show location, size and species of these plants on all landscape\n            plans. The determination of density requirements for trees and shrubs (high, medium\n            or low) will be verified by the Watershed Protection and Development Review Department\n            after analysis of the natural vegetation existing on the site.\n            \n            \u2022\u2002The landscape design should consider necessary engineering constraints on placement\n            of trees and shrubs. Trees and shrubs should not be placed where their root systems\n            may block pipes in drainfield areas. In general, trees and shrubs required for this\n            revegetation should be planted on the perimeter of the disturbed areas where they\n            will not interfere with necessary engineering functions.\n            \n            \u2022\u2002In addition to the above criteria, placement of detention/ sedimentation ponds or\n            wastewater drainfields within the highway buffer should achieve the following objectives\n            (in descending order of importance):\n\n               -\u2002Minimum encroachment on critical environment features.\n\n               -\u2002Minimum removal of surveyed native trees.\n\n               -\u2002Suitability for engineering needs; for example, when a certain area is the only\n               location for a pond or drainfield.\n\n               -\u2002Placement where least visible from adjacent roadways.\n\n            \u2022en;Special Buffer Requirements for Southwest Parkway. All sites located along Southwest\n            Parkway need only a 50 foot highway buffer instead of the 100 foot buffer required\n            on all other Hill Country roadways. The minimum building setback for these sites is\n            75 feet from the right of way or dedicated easement.\n            \n            D.\n            \n            Landscape in Parking Lots.\n            \n            1.\n            \n            Medians.\n            \n            A median at least ten (10) feet in width must be placed between all parking bays.\n            Within this median, a minimum number of trees must be kept or installed in order to\n            provide a dense massing of trees. No shrubs are required.\n            \n            2.\n            \n            Median Trees.\n            \n            The method of calculating adequate density of tree massing will be based on providing\n            or preserving an average of one (1) large tree and two (2) small trees for every 20\n            linear feet of median length.

The berm's height should be at least three (3) feet along its entire length\n            and maximum side slope should be no steeper than four (4) feet horizontal for every\n            one (1) foot vertical. Show berm location, height and slope on grading and landscape\n            plans. The berm should be placed so as to blend with the natural surroundings on the\n            site.\n            \n            6.\n            \n            Topography Used for Screening.\n            \n            If it can be demonstrated that those site improvements required to be screened will\n            not be visible at all from adjacent properties or roadways, due to significant differences\n            in elevation, this elevational difference will be accepted in lieu of vegetative screening.\n            A person should provide sections, at appropriate intervals, illustrating the topographic\n            differences noted above in order to receive credit under this provision.\n            \n            7.\n            \n            Screening Cuts and Fills.\n            \n            \u2022\u2002Screening of all cuts and fills shall conform to the criteria identified in Paragraphs\n            1-6 above.\n            \n            \u2022\u2002In order to preserve or install adequate screening, areas of cut to be screened\n            should be a minimum of ten (10) feet from any adjacent property line (including right\n            of way lines).\n            \n            \u2022\u2002The preservation of existing vegetation to provide the required screening, rather\n            than installation of new material, is strongly encouraged.\n            \n            \u2022\u2002If shrubs or trees are installed to meet this provision, planting in naturalistic,\n            informal groupings is encouraged, in order to blend in with surrounding natural areas.\n            \n            \u2022\u2002Hillside vegetation shall be preserved and disturbed only to locate structures.\n            These areas should be identified as discussed above with a limit of construction and\n            revegetated according to the standards in Appendix A.\n            \n            \u2022\u2002The same constraints regarding placement of construction limits will apply to any\n            disturbance or development adjacent to such hillside vegetation.\n            \n            \u2022\u2002Revegetation of these areas will be done according to the restoration criteria (see\n            Appendix A). Show location, size and species of these plants on all landscape working\n            plans. The determination of density requirements for trees and shrubs (high, medium\n            or low) will be verified after analysis of the existing natural vegetation remaining\n            on the site or on nearby sites.\n            \n            \u2022\u2002If terraces are not provided in the design, the cut and fill areas are to be restored\n            to 3:1 slopes and revegetated appropriately.\n            \n            F.\n            \n            Protection of Natural Areas.\n            \n            1.\n            \n            A limit of construction should be clearly shown and fully explained in the plan legend.\n            The construction limit line should include all buildings, parking and vehicular use\n            areas and all areas of cut and fill. Within the limit of construction, all requirements\n            for the following shall be included:\n            \n            \u2022\u2002Tree survey and tree replacement.\n            \n            \u2022\u2002Revegetation of disturbed area.\n            \n            \u2022\u2002Revegetation of ponds, waste water and drainfields.\n            \n            \u2022\u2002Landscape screening areas.\n            \n            \u2022\u2002All required landscape plantings.\n            \n            2.\n            \n            When considering placement of the limit of construction line, construction practices\n            generally require a minimum of 20 feet from all development to feasibly protect vegetation.\n            If the construction line is located closer than 20 feet, the grading, drainage and\n            tree protection plans should reflect the following:\n            \n            \u2022\u2002All existing and proposed contours at two (2) foot intervals for the area in question.\n            \n            \u2022\u2002Finish grade of the areas adjacent to the area in question (especially buildings\n            and parking lots)\n            \n            \u2022\u2002The relocated limit of construction line no closer than five (5) feet from the construction.\n            \n            If the preliminary grading plan demonstrates that it is feasible to do so, the construction\n            line may be placed from 20 feet down to five (5) feet away from any proposed development;\n            (at a distance closer than five (5) feet, the feasibility of preserving a natural\n            area becomes questionable).\n            \n            3.\n            \n            It is important that all disturbance of natural areas which may occur is included\n            within the construction limit line. This should include disturbance which is either\n            permanent or temporary. Temporary disturbance would include such things as job shacks,\n            staging areas, worker parking, construction vehicle access, etc.\n            \n            \u2022\u2002All plans must note \"Natural Area to Remain Undisturbed\" at reasonable intervals\n            in areas beyond the Limit of Construction Line.\n            \n            \u2022\u2002A tree survey is not required for areas outside the limits of construction.\n            \n            4.\n            \n            Subsequent disturbance to designated natural areas required by the LDC may constitute\n            a violation of these provisions and will require revegetation according to the standards\n            in Appendix A.\n            \n            5.\n            \n            Reasonable and feasible disturbance of a natural area should only include the following:\n            \n            \u2022\u2002Standard tree maintenance, such as removal of dead or diseased trees, pruning, etc.\n            \n            \u2022\u2002Limited landscape maintenance (removal of poison ivy, greenbriar, etc.).\n            \n            \u2022\u2002Installation of small hiking trails, benches, etc.\n            \n            6.\n            \n            Other proposals for selected clearing will be accepted and reviewed only on a case-by-case\n            basis. Wholesale removal of any vegetation will not be approved in any event.\n            \n            7.\n            \n            The placement of construction limit lines is subject to requirements of other provisions\n            of the LDC.\n            \n            G.\n            \n            Irrigation.\n            \n            1.\n            \n            All trees installed to compensate for native trees removed and all trees, shrubs,\n            grass and wildflowers installed to meet restoration requirements, must have irrigation\n            provided, as per Section 2.4.6. (No irrigation will be required for grass and wildflowers installed to restore areas\n            used in the past for ranching, as long as they are not disturbed during the construction\n            process.) Such irrigation may consist of a drip system or porous-pipe system, conventional\n            spray system, bubbler or the use of water trucks or any other means reasonable to\n            ensure that water will be provided to the plants. Systems used may be either permanent\n            or temporary, as long as they provide a constant moisture level at an amount and frequency\n            adequate to sustain growth for at least the first two (2) years after planting. Any\n            systems used must be maintained and kept operational at all times to provide for efficient\n            water distribution.\n            \n            2.\n            \n            No irrigation is required for undisturbed natural areas or undisturbed existing trees.\n            \n            H.\n            \n            Inspections/Developer's Agreement.\n            \n            1.\n            \n            All restoration must normally be completed before the landscape inspection. Projects\n            which have not completed landscaping and irrigation before the final landscape inspection\n            may enter into a Developer's Agreement for Installation and Maintenance of Landscape\n            Materials. The Developer's Agreement allows up to six months to complete required\n            landscaping.\n            \n            The fiscal posting amount for the Developer's Agreement shall be based on contractor\n            estimates of current cost for the material and labor for installation of all required\n            landscape and irrigation on the City of Austin approved landscape plan.\n            \n            The contractor's estimate for landscape shall include plant materials listed on the\n            landscape plan, turf, bed preparation, topsoil, mulch, labor and any native seeding\n            requirements. The estimates must be dated within 12 months of the request for an agreement\n            and must list suppliers who can provide the required items.\n            \n            The contractor's estimate for irrigation shall include a signed and sealed bid from\n            a licensed irrigator as well as a copy of the landscape irrigation plan signed and\n            sealed by a licensed irrigator. The estimates and plan must be dated within 12 months\n            of the request for an agreement\n            \n            The estimates must be submitted to the City of Austin Landscape Inspector by a landscape\n            architect for review and acceptance before a Developer's Agreement is written. If\n            fiscal is posted with another City entity (e.g., City Arborist) for portions of the\n            required landscape (e.g., mitigation trees), the amount shall be subtracted from the\n            required fiscal upon proof of payment.\n            \n            The fiscal is returned only after a concurrence letter for landscape is received and\n            the final inspection for landscape and irrigation is passed.",

    "content": "A.\n            \n            Required Field Data.\n            \n            Tree data must be obtained from a ground survey. The data which must be obtained in\n            the field are tree locations, trunk diameters and species. It is critical that the\n            survey provides accurate measurements to ensure that the survey is complete and that\n            both protected and heritage trees are clearly identified. The method of identifying\n            crown area is discussed later (Section 3.5.2.B Crown Impacts) and does not need to\n            be field measured. A dated tree survey associated with subdivision and site plan applications\n            must be certified by a surveying professional (a registered professional land surveyor\n            in the State of Texas and conducted in accordance with the most current land surveying\n            practice pertaining to topographic, easements and boundary surveys). Surveys for trees\n            associated with residential building permits typically do not need to be certified.\n            However city staff has the ability to require a certified survey from the applicant\n            if the provided tree information is inaccurate or is insufficient for assessing impacts\n            from proposed development. Tree surveys are only accurate for five years due to changes\n            in tree health and trunk growth. The City Arborist will require a new survey if the\n            survey information is no longer accurate. Failure to submit accurate and complete\n            information at the time of application may result in delays in the permitting process,\n            including the issuance and release of permits. Additionally the applicant is encouraged\n            to conduct a tree evaluation to assist in the design and review processes (see Section\n            3.3.2.B Recommended Additional Field Data).\n            \n            1.\n            \n            Location.\n            \n            Tree surveys must be accurate. Levels of inaccuracy which will result in a failure\n            to comply with the City tree preservation design criteria and construction specifications\n            may necessitate new surveys and plan adjustments either prior to permit approval or\n            project release. The location of all trees which are to be surveyed should be identified\n            at the center point of the tree trunk at ground level.\n            \n            Off-site trees whose Critical Root Zones enter the proposed development site shall\n            be shown on the plan. If off-site trees cannot be accessed by the surveyor their location\n            and diameter shall be approximated.\n            \n            Heritage trees shall be identified with the letter \"H\" on the tree survey and tree\n            list to clearly distinguish them as Heritage trees. Right-of-way trees shall be identified\n            with an asterisk.\n            \n            2.\n            \n            Trunk Diameter.\n            \n            Generally, tree diameters are measured at 4-\u00bd feet above grade (diameter at breast\n            height). The measurement provides the most accurate dimension of the tree's cross-sectional\n            diameter. If the tree is on a slope, measure from the high side of the slope. Measure\n            below unusual swells in the trunk (see Figure 3-1 in Appendix V of this manual) to\n            avoid inaccurate measurements.\n            \n            Diameter shall be accurate to the half inch. Measurements falling between half-inch\n            increments should be rounded down. For example, an 18.9 inch tree should be recorded\n            as an 18.5 inch tree.\n            \n            The diameter of a multi-trunk tree shall be determined by the total of the diameter\n            of the largest trunk plus \u00bd the diameter of each additional trunk. All trunks with\n            a diameter of one (1) inch or greater shall be included in this calculation, except\n            in Hill Country Roadway Corridors as noted in Section 3.3.4. Identify multi-trunk trees within the tree inventory by listing the cumulative diameter\n            with an M (multi-trunk). Identify each of the stem sizes when heritage trees are listed.\n            A multi-trunked tree is differentiated from individual trees growing from a common\n            root stock if there is a visible connection between the trunks above ground. Trunks\n            of different species should be considered separate trees, no matter how closely aligned.\n            \n            For Ashe juniper (Juniperus ashei), often referred to as cedar trees, only single-trunk trees with diameters eight\n            (8) inches and greater or multi-trunk specimens with at least one such sized trunk\n            need be surveyed. The intent of this provision is to encourage the preservation of\n            those mature cedars which provide valuable habitat for various species, while lessening\n            the overall cost of the survey.\n            \n            3.\n            \n            Tree Species.\n            \n            Tree identification should be accurate to the species level (e.g. post oak, Spanish\n            oak, cedar elm, etc.).\n            \n            Trees may be identified by common names or botanical names (e.g. post oak or Quercus stellata).\n            \n            B.\n            \n            Recommended Additional Field Data.\n            \n            Additional information which would greatly aid project designers and reviewers in\n            their efforts would include crown configuration, crown clearance, condition, spot\n            elevation and tree number.\n            \n            1.\n            \n            Crown Configuration.\n            \n            If a tree has a crown which is skewed in one (1) direction, this information would\n            be useful for surveyors to note. Project designers and plan reviewers need such information\n            to more accurately assess design impacts on such trees.\n            \n            The Critical Root Zone discussed in Section 3.3.2 D below supplants the \"crown size\" required by the LDC.\n            \n            2.\n            \n            Crown Clearance.\n            \n            This information is often critical in determining whether a given structure or vehicular\n            use area can practically be placed within the dripline of a tree. If this information\n            is recorded, the surveyor should consider the vertical distance to any major branches.\n            \n            3.\n            \n            Condition.\n            \n            This is one of the principle factors in determining whether a tree should or should\n            not be preserved. Surveyors should not speculate about the condition of all trees\n            unless they have the necessary credentials; however, if a tree is obviously in poor\n            condition, it should be noted to prevent unnecessary expense in trying to design around\n            it.\n            \n            4.\n            \n            Spot Elevation.\n            \n            Taking an elevation reading near the trunks of some trees will provide valuable information\n            for project designers. Since grade changes are the most destructive impacts on trees,\n            it is important to get the most accurate information possible.\n            \n            5.\n            \n            Tree Numbers.\n            \n            Tagging trees in the field with numbers corresponding to the trees shown on plans\n            is extremely useful. Such numbered tags reduce time spent by project designers, plan\n            reviewers, and contractors in determining the location of any given tree. Numbered\n            aluminum tags are available from most survey and forestry suppliers.\n            \n            C.\n            \n            Limits of Surveys.\n            \n            If there is an area which is known at the time of the survey to be on the project\n            site or easement but outside the buildable area, a limits of construction line may\n            be established. Trees beyond this line need not be surveyed provided the following\n            conditions are met:\n            \n            \u2022\u2002The limits of construction must be fenced throughout all phases of construction.\n            \n            \u2022\u2002A general description of the numbers, species and sizes of trees in the area beyond\n            the limits of construction must be provided as a plan note.\n            \n            D.\n            \n            Plan Graphics.\n            \n            The standard tree graphics discussed below are important to provide consistent information\n            in the most useful format for efficient plan review.\n            \n            1.\n            \n            Trunk Location.\n            \n            The tree trunk location on the plan must represent the center of the trunk at ground\n            level, clearly identifying heritage and protected trees on the drawing and plan legend.\n            If the tree leans substantially above that point, depict the direction of the lean\n            with an arrow.\n            \n            2.\n            \n            Critical Root Zone.\n            \n            Trees are to be represented on plans by a circle centered on the trunk location, where\n            the radius of the circle is a number of feet equal to the diameter in inches of the\n            tree. The area within this circle is referred to as the critical root zone (CRZ).\n            The CRZ is used by plan reviewers to determine compliance with design standards and\n            construction specifications.\n            \n            Trees proposed to be retained are to be represented by a solid circle.\n            \n            Trees proposed to be removed are to be represented by a dashed circle.\n            \n            Trees proposed to be retained but have not met preservation requirements (defined\n            in ECM 3.5.2 Tree Preservation Design Criteria) are to be represented by a shaded circle.\n            \n            Trees proposed to be planted are to be graphically differentiated from existing trees.\n            \n            3.\n            \n            Diameters and Species.\n            \n            Tree diameters and species must be shown. This information should be shown adjacent\n            to each trunk location. For sites with many trees, this data may be shown in list\n            form.\n            \n            4.\n            \n            Tree Protection.\n            \n            Tree protection is required for all preserved trees consistent with ECM 3.6.1.

    "content": "This section identifies tree preservation requirements and impacts that constitute\n            removal of regulated trees. When preservation requirements are not met the tree is\n            considered removed.\n            \n            A.\n            \n            Standard Preservation Requirements\n            \n            1.\n            \n            Critical Root Zone\n            \n            While the full root system of the tree may extend three to four times the diameter\n            of the dripline, the Critical Root Zone (CRZ) is an area surrounding the tree where\n            root protection is important to tree survival. The CRZ is a circle centered on the\n            tree where the radius of the circle is a number of feet equal to the diameter in inches\n            of the tree. All ground within that circle is the CRZ. The Half Critical Root Zone\n            and Quarter Critical Root Zone are also used by staff to evaluate the likelihood of\n            tree survival. The Half CRZ is a smaller circle within the CRZ with a radius half\n            that of the CRZ. The Quarter CRZ is a circle within the Half CRZ with a radius one-quarter\n            that of the CRZ. The figure below depicts the CRZ, Half CRZ, and Quarter CRZ.\n\n               Certain conditions may require a larger Critical Root Zone to expect tree survival.\n               The City Arborist may request a larger preserved area for species that are less resilient\n               to the impacts of development, such as post oak (Quercus stellata), high value trees, rare trees, and trees in sensitive site conditions. This request\n               could identify a CRZ 1\u00bc to 1\u00bd times larger than the minimum standard.\n\n               Design constraints, such as site conditions, often dictate that trees slated for preservation\n               have some root zone disturbance. Critical Root Zone impacts reduce a tree's likelihood\n               of survival. Impacts include:\n\n               a.\n\n               Digging, trenching, or excavating;\n\n               b.\n\n               Soil compaction;\n\n               c.\n\n               Grade changes; and\n\n               d.\n\n               Chemical exposure and spills.\n\n               Most trees can tolerate some Critical Root Zone impacts. Impacts may be allowed as\n               long as the following Preservation Criteria are met:\n\n               a.\n\n               At least fifty percent of the total area (square footage) of the Critical Root Zone\n               must be preserved at natural grade, with natural ground cover.\n\n               b.\n\n               The entirety of the Half CRZ must be protected, with the exception that cut or fill\n               of four inches or less is allowed within the Half CRZ.\n\n               c.\n\n               No cut or fill is allowed within the Quarter CRZ.\n\n               2.\n\n               Crown\n\n               Excessive pruning constitutes removal of a regulated tree per Land Development Code\n               25-8-603. Pruning shall conform to the most recent ANSI A300 pruning standard. Not\n               more than twenty-five percent of the foliage shall be removed within an annual growing\n               season. The percentage and distribution of foliage to be removed shall be adjusted\n               according to the plant's species, age, health, and site. The intent of crown preservation\n               is to ensure that sufficient foliage remains to allow for long-term continuation of\n               critical biological functions. The City Arborist will determine if the intent of crown\n               preservation is met.\n\n               Pruning during construction shall comply with the requirements of this section. Failure\n               to account for the particular branch structure of any regulated tree may result in\n               a plan revision and project delay if approved plans require pruning that would not\n               comply with crown preservation requirements.\n\n               3.\n\n               Construction Impacts\n\n               Construction impacts shall not exceed the requirements of Environmental Criteria Manual\n               3.5.2. Construction impacts are any impacts necessary to build what is shown on plans.\n               Examples include site access, material staging, scaffolding locations, concrete form\n               bracing, over excavation, utility excavation, post holes for fences, and grade changes.\n               When the installation of any artificial ground cover, such as porous pavement or artificial\n               turf, requires grading, excavation, or compaction these are also considered impacts.\n\n               For example, the installation of a curb typically requires excavation behind the back\n               of the curb. In such a case, the line of impact on the Critical Root Zone will be\n               at the line of excavation rather than at the curb line shown on the plan. If the curb\n               is shown exactly at the Half CRZ the scenario is not compliant with preservation requirements.\n               This is because the actual impact from the excavation goes beyond what is shown on\n               the plans and exceeds the allowable impacts.\n\n               Similarly, scaffolding may require pruning beyond what is necessary for a building\n               envelope. A building wall may require the removal of only twenty percent of the crown,\n               but the scaffolding necessary to construct the building may require the removal of\n               an additional twenty percent. This scenario is not compliant with preservation standards\n               because the pruning required to construct the building, including the scaffolding\n               requirements, exceeds the twenty-five percent limit.\n\n               B.\n\n               Alternative Compliance Methods\n\n               The methods below may allow for exceptions to the standard preservation requirements\n               of Environmental Criteria Manual 3.5.2.A. Use of these methods is at the discretion\n               of the City Arborist.\n\n               1.\n\n               Remedial Tree Care\n\n               A remedial tree care plan may be required when proposed impacts or unpermitted impacts\n               during construction exceed what is allowed under Environmental Criteria Manual 3.5.2.A.\n               The City Arborist shall review the proposed care plan to ensure it will address impacts\n               that exceed standard preservation requirements. Remedial tree care plans shall be\n               documented in approved development plans. Tree care plan proposals shall be prepared\n               and implemented by a qualified arborist, address specific impacts, and conform to\n               the ANSI A300 standard for tree care and industry best practices. Proposals may include:\n\n               \u2022\u2002Initial inspection and assessment;\n\n               \u2022\u2002Corrective pruning to address trunk or canopy injuries or hazards;\n\n               \u2022\u2002Site monitoring during construction to ensure compliance with required tree protection\n               per ECM 3.6;\n\n               \u2022\u2002Supplemental irrigation during or after construction as well as a monitoring program\n               to ensure appropriate moisture levels;\n\n               \u2022\u2002Decompaction of compacted soil within the Critical Root Zone;\n\n               \u2022\u2002Application of organic material, soil amendments, or fertilizer based on assessment\n               of soil conditions; or\n\n               \u2022\u2002Post construction monitoring of tree condition.\n\n               2.\n\n               Low-Impact Excavation\n\n               Low-impact excavation may be allowed within areas of restricted root zone where excavation\n               would normally be prohibited. Low-impact excavation methods, such as hand digging\n               or compressed air, must allow for soil excavation without damage to significant roots.\n               Roots with a diameter of 1\u00bd inches or greater are considered significant. The City\n               Arborist may authorize removal of significant roots if this will not result in removal\n               of the tree.\n\n               Boring or tunneling under the root zone may be allowed at a sufficient depth to avoid\n               roots. Access pits for boring or tunnelling must be compliant with Environmental Criteria\n               Manual 3.5.2.A.\n\n               3.\n\n               Elevated Foundations\n\n               Elevated foundations may be allowed within the Half Critical Root Zone. Elevated foundations\n               may not span or impact the Quarter CRZ. Elevated foundation types include pier and\n               beam, cantilevered slab, or any design that spans the Half CRZ. Areas of elevated\n               foundation are counted as impacts when calculating preservation of fifty percent of\n               the CRZ. Elevated foundations shall meet the following requirements:\n\n               1.\n\n               Elevated foundations shall provide an air gap or void with a minimum height of four\n               inches between the bottom of the foundation and natural grade.\n\n               2.\n\n               The soil beneath void spaces shall be preserved at natural grade per ECM 3.5.2.A.1.\n\n               3.\n\n               Piers may be allowed in the Half CRZ if low-impact methods are used during excavation\n               and significant roots are not damaged except as approved by the City Arborist.\n\n               4.\n\n               When concrete is poured in the Half CRZ the hole shall be lined with a non-leaching\n               barrier.\n\n               4.\n\n               Alternative Critical Root Zone Configurations\n\n               Existing site features may affect the Critical Root Zone in at least two ways. They\n               may limit the growth of feeder roots in their footprint. These features may also function\n               as a barrier to root growth in adjacent soil. For example, a sidewalk or a residential\n               driveway might prevent feeder root development under the pavement but not the growth\n               of larger woody roots into the yard opposite the tree whereas a slab foundation or\n               street would prevent both.\n\n               a.\n\n               Existing Impacts\n\n               Proposed impacts in the Half or Quarter Critical Root Zone are allowed within the\n               footprint of existing impacts if they do not exceed the depth or width of those impacts.\n               For example, if a slab foundation is present within the Half CRZ a new slab may be\n               allowed in the same location if the new excavation does not exceed the depth or width\n               of the existing excavation. However, a slab proposed in the footprint of a sidewalk\n               or driveway would not be allowed because it would require a greater depth of excavation.\n\n               Additional depth of impact may be allowed if the applicant demonstrates the absence\n               of significant roots. For example, a slab may be allowed within the footprint of a\n               driveway if the applicant shows that no significant roots are present in the area\n               of additional impact.\n\n               b.\n\n               Modified Critical Root Zone\n\n               Trees grow their root systems in response to the conditions and limitations of their\n               particular location. Root systems may not reflect the standard Critical Root Zone\n               configuration described in Environmental Criteria Manual 3.5.2.A. When previous development\n               or existing conditions have prevented root growth within some portion of the CRZ the\n               City Arborist will consider proposals for a modified CRZ (MCRZ). A standard CRZ may\n               include areas where roots are not present, such as beneath streets or under foundations.\n               The MCRZ provides design flexibility in these scenarios.\n\n               The total area of the MCRZ shall equal the area of the standard CRZ. The MCRZ may\n               only replace portions of the CRZ where roots are not present and shall replace it\n               with areas where roots are present. The City Arborist may require applicants to demonstrate\n               the location of roots prior to approving a MCRZ. Areas protected by the MCRZ shall\n               be continuous with the remaining CRZ and configured to be as compact as possible.\n\n               The MCRZ only replaces the CRZ to calculate preservation of fifty percent of the CRZ\n               per ECM 3.5.2.A.1. It does not modify the Half or Quarter CRZ preservation requirements.\n\n               5.\n\n               Transplants\n\n               Transplanting trees may be an option for preservation at the discretion of the City\n               Arborist. Transplanting trees has a significant risk for tree mortality if it is not\n               performed with a high level of technical expertise. Not all trees are good candidates\n               for transplant. Due to the inherent difficulties of this type of operation, a transplant\n               proposal prepared by a qualified arborist with proven experience transplanting large\n               trees must accompany such a request.\n\n               Transplant proposals shall include:\n\n               \u2022\u2002Condition and suitability of trees proposed for transplant;\n\n               \u2022\u2002Excavation and root ball stabilization method;\n\n               \u2022\u2002Transport method;\n\n               \u2022\u2002Transplant schedule;\n\n               \u2022\u2002Tree storage methods;\n\n               \u2022\u2002Remedial Tree care plan.\n\n               Additional information may be required for approval. Transplanted trees require fiscal\n               surety posted with the City. Trees must be transplanted in accordance with the approved\n               proposal.\n\n            Source: Rule No. R161-22.16, 12-14-2022.",

    "content": "Mitigation for the removal of regulated trees is required by Land Development Code\n            25-8-624(D), 25-8-642(D), and 25-8-643(B). Planting new trees or preservation of unregulated\n            trees are the primary forms of mitigation. Alternative mitigation may be approved\n            by the City Arborist when a site is unsuitable for planting per Environmental Criteria\n            Manual 3.5.4.B.3.a. Proposals that benefit the urban forest, including those that\n            preserve or restore natural areas, ecosystems, or plant communities, may be considered\n            for mitigation credit on a case-by-case basis.\n\n               A.\n\n               Calculating Mitigation\n\n               1.\n\n               Mitigation Rates\n\n               Mitigation is expressed as the total caliper inches of required replacement trees.\n               Mitigation shall be calculated by multiplying the diameter of the tree removed by\n               the percentage in the table below according to the tree's diameter and species.

On trees with\n               multiple stems only those stems with a caliper of at least one inch shall count towards\n               mitigation.

The City Arborist may approve species not listed in Appendix F for mitigation credit.\n               At least seventy-five percent of the total caliper of all replacement trees shall\n               be from species designated Significant Shade Providers in Appendix F. The remaining\n               twenty-five percent may be of any Appendix F species.\n\n               When twenty or more inches of replacement trees are planted on a site they must be\n               selected from at least two species. When one hundred or more inches of replacement\n               trees are planted on a site they must be selected from at least five species, with\n               no single species representing more than fifty percent of the total caliper of the\n               required mitigation.\n\n               c.\n\n               Planting Requirements\n\n               The planting locations of replacement trees shall comply with the requirements of\n               other regulating authorities such as Austin Energy or Austin Water. Replacement trees\n               shall be planted on the property where the mitigated tree was located unless an alternative\n               planting location is approved. Alternative planting locations should be in close proximity\n               to the original property.\n\n               d.\n\n               Quality Stock\n\n               Replacement trees shall be planted in accordance with the ANSI 300 standard for tree\n               care. Replacement trees shall be free of pests, disease, and significant damage or\n               structural defects. They shall have a visible root flare at the soil line and be planted\n               at the proper depth.\n\n               e.\n\n               Irrigation\n\n               Replacement trees shall be provided with irrigation for their establishment. When\n               added to an existing irrigation system they shall have their own zone so that they\n               can be watered at a frequency and rate appropriate to newly planted trees. On sites\n               without existing irrigation a programmable temporary system or a service such as a\n               water truck may be used.

These trees shall be shown on development plans\n               and protected during construction. Failure to meet preservation requirements shall\n               result in the loss of mitigation credit.\n\n               c.\n\n               Calculating Mitigation Credit\n\n               One inch of mitigation credit shall be given for each diameter inch of trees preserved\n               in this category, measured per ECM 3.3.2.A.2.\n\n               3.\n\n               Alternative Mitigation\n\n               On some sites the amount of required mitigation may exceed the space available for\n               replacement trees. When the City Arborist determines that a site is unsuitable for\n               the required planting, payment to the Urban Forest Replenishment Fund (UFRF) shall\n               be made. When a site can support some but not all the required mitigation the balance\n               shall be addressed through payment to the UFRF.\n\n               a.\n\n               Qualifying Criteria\n\n               The following criteria qualify a site for alternative mitigation:\n\n               \u2022\u2002Planting the required mitigation would exceed the understory species limits in 3.5.4.B.1.b;\n\n               \u2022\u2002The required mitigation would require denser spacing of replacement trees than is\n               appropriate to the site; or\n\n               \u2022\u2002Site conditions or future development make the survival of the replacement trees\n               unlikely.\n\n               b.\n\n               Payment Rate\n\n               Payments to the Urban Forest Replenishment Fund shall be made at $200 per inch of\n               required mitigation or $75 per inch for certified affordable developments. Payments\n               to the UFRF may be used for off-site tree planting and maintenance, promoting tree\n               care and preservation, urban forest conservation, and enforcement of City tree protection\n               and mitigation regulations.\n\n               Applicants may be entitled to a mitigation credit for tree planting under Texas Local\n               Government Code Section 212.905. An applicant claiming a credit should indicate this\n               on their application.\n\n            Source: Rule No. R161-22.16, 12-14-2022.",

Any premature removal\n            or failure of tree protection can lead to Critical Root Zone impacts as described\n            in ECM 3.5.2 and may require remedial tree care. It is the permit holder's responsibility to avoid\n            damage to preserved trees where tree protection has been removed or not installed.\n            \n            B.\n            \n            Fencing Specifications\n            \n            1.\n            \n            Material Requirements\n            \n            Fencing is the primary method of tree protection. Fencing is intended to prevent access\n            to the Critical Root Zone. Tree fencing shall be chain-link mesh with a minimum height\n            of 5 feet. Fencing shall be installed on steel t-posts with a maximum spacing of 10\n            feet between the posts. More robust or existing permanent fencing may be approved\n            as an alternative to chain-link fencing. Plastic fencing material shall not be used\n            as tree protection.\n            \n            2.\n            \n            Location of Fencing\n            \n            Fencing shall be installed around or beyond the Critical Root Zone of all preserved\n            trees or any natural areas designated for preservation. Fencing must be continuous\n            and create a closed, inaccessible area of root zone protection.\n            \n            3.\n            \n            Maintenance of Fenced Areas\n            \n            Fencing shall not be temporarily moved or removed during development without prior\n            authorization. There shall be minimal slack or sagging in the fence. The fenced Critical\n            Root Zone shall not be used for tool or material storage of any kind and shall be\n            kept free of litter.\n            \n            4.\n            \n            Exceptions to Fencing Requirements\n            \n            Any section of the Critical Root Zone not protected by fencing or covered by existing\n            hardscape requires mulch (see ECM 3.6.1.C). Exceptions to the CRZ fencing requirement\n            shall be justified by site-specific considerations. Some exceptions are for areas:\n            \n            i.\n            \n            that have been approved for impacts, such as the footprint of a building;\n            \n            ii.\n            \n            covered by existing hardscape, such as a patio or driveway (note: if hardscape is\n            removed the exposed soil beneath becomes subject to tree protection requirements);\n            \n            iii.\n            \n            required for access to the work area; and\n            \n            iv.\n            \n            approved for use as a staging area.\n            \n            Within the Half CRZ, fencing requirements will only be modified for existing hardscape\n            or to allow an access path adjacent to approved structures (see ECM 3.6.1.C.3). CRZ\n            fencing modifications shall be shown on the development plans or approved by the inspector.\n            \n            C.\n            \n            Mulch Specifications\n            \n            1.\n            \n            Material Requirements\n            \n            Mulch is required in any section of the Critical Root Zone that is not protected by\n            fencing or under existing hardscape and has not been approved for impacts (such as\n            building footprint or driveway). Mulch used for tree protection shall be any natural\n            wood type. Rough single grind mulch, which resists compaction better than double grind\n            and is usually less expensive is preferred but any natural wood type is acceptable.\n            Dyed mulch or mulch made from non-biological material such as rubber or stone shall\n            not be used as tree protection.\n            \n            2.\n            \n            Depth of Mulch\n            \n            Mulch shall be installed to a minimum depth of 8 inches. Mulch may need to be periodically\n            replenished depending on the duration of the project. Since excessive mulch is harmful\n            to trees, mulch shall not be installed to a depth greater than 12 inches. Mulch used\n            for tree protection shall be removed at the end of the project. Mulch shall never\n            be piled against tree trunks.\n            \n            3.\n            \n            Mulch Within the Half CRZ\n            \n            When mulch is used as alternative protection within the Half Critical Root Zone it\n            shall be topped by decking to provide additional protection against compaction.\n            \n            4.\n            \n            Exceptions to Mulch Requirements\n            \n            Mulch is not required within fenced sections of the Critical Root Zone where existing\n            turf or ground cover is present and undisturbed. Sections of bare or disturbed dirt\n            within the fenced CRZ shall be covered by a three-inch layer of mulch.\n            \n            D.\n            \n            Trunk and Branch Wrapping\n            \n            1.\n            \n            Trunk Wrap\n            \n            Wrapping is not required or recommended for most preserved trees. When necessary,\n            trunk wrap shall be installed to protect the first 8 feet of tree height whenever\n            protective fencing is located 5 feet or less from the trunk or when fencing cannot\n            be placed around the tree. This will usually only be the case when existing hardscape\n            provides Half Critical Root Zone protection or a structure has been approved for construction\n            within the Half CRZ using an existing historical footprint. These circumstances can\n            result in fencing closer to the trunk than would otherwise be allowed. Because trees\n            vary in form, 8 feet is a general guideline rather than an absolute standard. More\n            or less height of protection may be appropriate.\n            \n            2.\n            \n            Branch Wrap\n            \n            Branch wrap may be required when a major limb is over an access route or close to\n            a proposed structure. Proximity of scaffolding or other necessary construction equipment\n            needs to be considered.\n            \n            3.\n            \n            Material Requirements\n            \n            Dimensional lumber, such as 2x4s, shall be oriented parallel to and continuously around\n            the trunk or branch and secured in place by tightening wires run around the outside\n            of the lumber. Wrapping shall never be secured directly to the tree by screws or other\n            means. Wrapping shall be loosened and retightened every six months to prevent the\n            tree from being damaged as it grows outwards.\n            \n            E.\n            \n            Protection for Natural Areas\n            \n            Natural areas indicated for preservation on plans shall be protected by fencing that\n            meets the standards for tree fencing in this section. Alternative protection allowed\n            for trees is not acceptable for natural area preservation. Fencing shall be installed\n            at the Limit of Construction line shown on plans.\n            \n            Source: Rules No. R161-21.22, 9-15-2021.",

    "subtitle": "MONITORING PLAN GUIDE FOR UNDERGROUND TANK SYSTEMS",
    "content": "The purpose of the monitoring plan requirement is to insure that each permit applicant\n            is aware of his or her responsibilities to operate facilities with underground storage\n            tank systems in a safe manner which will assure that the site will not pose a present\n            or future threat to public health, safety or the environment. A suggested approach\n            to take in writing your Monitoring Plan would be to describe everything you do to\n            assure yourself that you do not have any leaks or spills of product at your facility\n            and if you did have a release how you would detect it. Remember, if any of the information\n            contained in your monitoring plan becomes outdated you will simply revise the plan\n            and you will only be obligated to follow the procedures described in the updated version\n            of the plan.\n            \n            You need to provide a description of your storage and dispensing systems in sufficient\n            detail to show that your monitoring and/or testing methods are appropriate. Describe\n            the materials of construction of the tanks and piping, the type of backfill used,\n            any manifolding of tanks or lines, the type of delivery system used (suction or submerged\n            pump, metered or unmetered), any vapor recovery systems used, etc.\n            \n            Provide a description of your inventory control system. Include a copy of your inventory\n            record forms and describe how and when your reconciliations are performed. For further\n            clarification see Appendix H, \"Inventory and Reconciliation Records.\" You need to\n            decide which tank and line monitoring method you will use - tank system testing, monitoring\n            wells or other approved leak detection systems. If you plan to have tank system tests\n            performed, provide the name and address of the tank testing company, give the type\n            of test that will be performed (Petrotite, Hunter, Mooney, etc.) and when the tests\n            will be performed. For example: \"Annually during the month of October.\"\n            \n            For new facilities with piping that will be visually inspected, you should include\n            a copy of the inspection reports or log book you use for this purpose. The inspection\n            report or log book should contain a brief written description of the equipment being\n            inspected and an explanation of what the inspector will be looking for to ascertain\n            if a spill or leak has occurred. Do not simply use wording like \"check for leaks,\"\n            but describe what the inspector will do or look for to check for leaks.\n            \n            If the monitoring well option is used, you need to give a complete description of\n            the well(s). The description should include the number, location, depth, materials\n            of construction, the type of geologic material they are placed in and the type of\n            detection system used. If the system does not monitor in a continuous mode, you need\n            to specify the sampling and analysis schedule that will be followed and the parameters\n            that will be analyzed for. Only Environmental Protection Agency approved analytical\n            methods should be used. The detection limits of any sensors or analytical procedures\n            must be noted as well as the levels that will be set to trigger an alarm. A report\n            of any background levels of contamination should also be included in the plan.\n            \n            If other approved leak detection systems such as sensor cables, tracer detectors,\n            surface geophysical methods, etc. are used, the system must be described in enough\n            detail to show how the system is designed to operate and to demonstrate that it will\n            provide adequate leak detection capabilities.\n            \n            All facilities with underground storage tank systems, must include in their monitoring\n            plan, emergency leak response procedures for operations at the facility. For further\n            clarification see Appendix I, \"Contingency Plans.\" These procedures will be posted\n            at the facility in such a way that any employee can determine when a leak detector\n            or alarm has been tripped. The procedures will indicate:\n\n               \u2022\u2002Who to contact; maintenance office, tank and pump repair service, area manager,\n               regulatory agency, etc.\n\n               \u2022\u2002What measures to take until the responding party arrives; discontinue service from\n               that system, shut off the pump, etc.\n\n            Listed below are some questions your monitoring plan should answer:\n\n               \u2022\u2002Of what material are my tanks and piping constructed?\n\n               \u2022\u2002Do I have a suction lift (pump at dispenser) pressure delivery (pump at tank) system?\n\n               \u2022\u2002How do I account for my product inventory?\n\n               \u2022\u2002How do I monitor the tanks for leaks? Do I have tank tests performed or do I use\n               monitoring wells?\n\n               \u2022\u2002Which tank system test do I use and when will it be performed?\n\n               \u2022\u2002How do I monitor or test the piping for leaks?\n\n               \u2022\u2002Where are my monitoring wells located and how are they constructed?\n\n               \u2022\u2002How do I use the monitoring wells to discover leaks, for what do I sample and when?\n\n               \u2022\u2002How do I protect against overfills?\n\n               \u2022\u2002What do I do and look for when I perform my visual inspections at the site?\n\n               \u2022\u2002What do I do to insure that my monitoring devices and equipment are functioning\n               properly?

Monitoring wells must be placed adjacent to the\n            tank system with at least one (1) well placed in the backfill area and/or down gradient\n            from the tank system. Monitoring wells may be used to obtain periodic vapor and/or\n            liquid grab samples for laboratory analyses or they may be fitted with continuous\n            electronic monitoring systems. All monitoring systems must be capable of differentiating\n            between product and water. Grab sampling and analyses must be performed at least once\n            every quarter. The results of these analyses must be retained on file at the facility\n            for a period of not less than three (3) years. Any alarms from continuous electronic\n            monitoring systems must be noted in a log maintained at the facility.

    "subtitle": "CLOSURE PLAN",
    "content": "The purpose of the Closure Plan requirement in the Hazardous Materials Underground\n            Storage Tank Registration Ordinance is to insure that each permit applicant is prepared\n            to meet his or her responsibilities to close underground storage tank systems in an\n            environmentally safe manner, should their use be discontinued. A suggested approach\n            to take in writing your closure plan is to assume you will close your facility tomorrow,\n            then describe everything you would do to assure the site will not pose a present or\n            future threat to public health, safety or the environment. Please remember that if\n            at some future date you actually do close the facility, you will at that time submit\n            an updated Closure Plan in which you will modify any of the information that had changed\n            in the meantime.\n            \n            You need to decide which closure method you will use, removing the tanks or closing\n            them in place and briefly describe how the closure would be performed. You should\n            choose a contractor capable of handling the closure and provide the name and address\n            of that company in the closure plan. Contractors for removing or filling the underground\n            storage tanks can be found in the telephone book under the heading \"General Contractors\"\n            or specialized contractors can be found under the heading \"Service Station Equipment.\"\n            \n            You should also choose a consultant and/or an analytical laboratory that would be\n            available to handle any sampling, lab analysis or clean up proposals that may be required.\n            Provide the name and address of these companies in the plan, also. Consultants available\n            for providing sampling and analysis services or for writing proposals for cleanups\n            can be found in the telephone directory under the heading of \"Engineers - Environmental.\"\n            You should keep in mind that you will most likely face three (3) possible contingencies\n            during an underground tank closure:\n\n               \u2022\u2002The site will be found to be uncontaminated and no cleanup will be required.\n\n               \u2022\u2002The site will have some contamination but can be proved to not require any cleanup.\n\n               \u2022\u2002The site will be significantly contaminated and some form of remedial action will\n               be required to clean up or decontaminate the site.\n\n            A consultant may be necessary to help you prove that the first two (2) contingent\n            situations exist or to help you develop a proposal for the third contingency.\n            \n            A highly recommended starting point in a closure operation would be to specify that\n            before any other actions are taken, an observation well will be installed in the tank\n            pit backfill area. A simple \"sticking\" with hydrocarbon finding paste can then be\n            taken in this well or soil or water samples can be contained and analyzed for hydrocarbon\n            contamination. This simple, relatively inexpensive, procedure could be invaluable\n            in giving you some idea of what kinds of problems can be anticipated before you ever\n            \"break concrete\" at the closure site. From this information you will have a very good\n            idea if the site is relatively clean or if more sampling wells will be needed before\n            any other work is done.\n            \n            Some helpful ideas and recommended practices for closing underground storage tanks\n            can be found in NFPA 329, \"Recommended Practice for Handling Underground Leakage of\n            Flammable and Combustible Liquids,\" API Bulletin 1604, \"Recommended Practice for Abandonment\n            or Removal of Used Underground Service Station Tanks,\" 1981 and API Bulletin 1628,\n            \"Underground Spill Cleanup Manual,\" 1980. For information on closure guides based\n            on these references, contact the Department of Environmental Protection, Underground\n            Storage Tank Unit offices.\n            \n            Listed below are some questions your closure plan should answer:\n\n               \u2022\u2002What will I do to reduce any safety hazards that will be incurred during the closure\n               operation?\n\n               \u2022\u2002How will I safely dispose of any remaining inventory?\n\n               \u2022\u2002What will I do with the tanks?\n\n               \u2022\u2002Will I close them in place? If so, with what will I fill them? Or, will I have them\n               removed? And if so, how will I safely dispose of them?\n\n               \u2022\u2002What will I do with the piping? Cap it, plug it or remove it?\n\n               \u2022\u2002Who will be the contractor(s) to handle the tank closure?\n\n               \u2022\u2002In what general type of geologic material is the tank site located (clay, rock,\n               etc.)?\n\n               \u2022\u2002How will I determine if the site is contaminated?\n\n               \u2022\u2002If there is any contamination, what will I do to assure that it is cleaned up?\n\n               \u2022\u2002What parameters will I sample for and where?\n\n               \u2022\u2002What analytical methods will be used and are they Environmental Protection Agency\n               approved methods?\n\n               \u2022\u2002Who will be the consultant(s) or contractor(s) I will use to handle the sampling,\n               analysis and cleanup proposals?",

This operation is usually finished off by hand pumping\n               at both ends of the tank, if possible. There should be no freestanding liquids.\n\n               NOTE: Notify the Department of Environmental Protection at least 24 hours in advance\n               of the filling operations to arrange for an inspector to be present at the site.\n\n               5.\n\n               While verifying that the site is safe, using a combustible gas detector, fill the\n               tank with a concrete slurry or other material, as approved by the Department of Environmental\n               Protection, capable of filling all voids and hardening to a solid consistency.\n\n               6.\n\n               Disconnect the vent lines and remove, cap or plug them.\n\n               B.\n\n               Removal of Tanks.\n\n               1.\n\n               Drain and flush all piping into the tank.\n\n               2.\n\n               Disconnect all piping at the tank and remove cap or plug it, as appropriate.\n\n               3.\n\n               Remove all liquids from the tank. This operation is usually finished off by hand pumping\n               at both ends of the tank. There should be no free standing liquid left in the tank\n               prior to the inerting operations.\n\n               NOTE: Tank inerting is to be completed four (4) to 24 hours prior to the removal operations.\n               Notify the Department of Environmental Protection at least 24 hours in advance of\n               the inerting and the removal operations to arrange for the inspector to be present\n               at the site.\n\n               4.\n\n               Inert the tank by purging it with carbon dioxide gas. The recommended procedure is\n               to add crushed dry ice into the tank in the amount of 15 pounds per 1,000 gallons\n               of tank capacity. During the addition of the dry ice, the tank will be venting flammable\n               vapors. Special precautions to eliminate sources of ignition at the site and provisions\n               for the use of respiratory protection should be followed.\n\n               5.\n\n               After the dry ice has been introduced into the tank, allow the tank to purge vapors\n               for at least one (1) hour.

These containers\n            must be highly resistant to the hazardous materials they are designed to contain and\n            must also be resistant to the environment in which they are stored and any physical\n            handling they may be subject to for their projected design life.\n            \n            All storage tanks must bear Underwriters Laboratory, American Petroleum Institute,\n            Steel Tank Institute, Factory Mutual or other agency labels certifying adherence to\n            specified construction methods and factory pressure testing for tank integrity.\n            \n            Underground tanks, including double-walled tanks, should be equipped with some form\n            of anti-corrosion system such as fiberglass reinforced plastic or other synthetic\n            material cladding or cathodic protection.\n            \n            The tank must be installed according to the manufacturer's specifications.\n            \n            The tank must be compatible with the stored material over the projected life of the\n            tank.\n            \n            Where dissimilar metals are connected to a steel tank, nonconducting dielectric bushings\n            must be used at each connection. The bushing material must be able to withstand exposure\n            to the material to be stored without swelling or degradation.\n            \n            All underground piping must slope back to the tank a minimum of 1/8 inch per foot\n            of length. In those situations when this is not feasible, additional monitoring points\n            of the secondary containment may be required by the Department of Environmental Protection.\n            Vent lines shall also be sloped back to the tanks. Except for double-walled piping,\n            underground product piping shall be installed with minimum distances of six (6) inches\n            to all secondary containment surfaces. Piping should not cross over tanks, wherever\n            possible, nor should it be routed within six (6) inches of underground waterlines,\n            sewer lines, air lines, conduit, etc. Product piping shall be installed with bracing\n            or adequate spacing between lines so as to prevent detrimental contact between the\n            lines.\n            \n            Underground storage tanks shall be installed with minimum distances of two (2) feet\n            to all secondary containment surfaces.

Minimum backfill over\n            fiber glass tanks shall be three (3) feet. Backfill materials shall be washed sand\n            or pea gravel compacted in 12 inch lifts - rocks, clay, topsoil and refuse will not\n            be allowed in the backfill material.\n            \n            Underground storage tanks shall have a final cover of reinforced concrete or asphalt\n            of sufficient strength to bear any anticipated traffic loadings. In those situations\n            where an underground storage tank is to be located in a non-traffic location, the\n            asphalt or concrete may be deleted. The final cover shall extend a minimum of 12 inches\n            past the horizontal boundaries of the excavation. The area around any piping or other\n            appurtenance that enters an underground storage tank system through the final cover\n            must be built up a minimum of two (2) inches to inhibit run-on into the system.

    "content": "Secondary containment systems shall be compatible with the environment in which they\n            are installed for the projected life of the systems and must be compatible with the\n            contents of the primary container(s) for the amount of time they would reasonably\n            be expected to contain the material between the time a leak would be detected and\n            when cleanup operations would occur.\n            \n            Systems for secondary containment for underground storage tanks, other than for double-walled\n            tanks, will require engineered designs. The design submittals shall be stamped by\n            one or more engineers registered by the State of Texas, attesting to the structural\n            soundness of the systems, the compatibility of the construction materials with the\n            environment and the stored materials, the corrosion protection afforded by the design\n            and the soundness of any hydrogeologic design elements. These systems shall be installed\n            according to the manufacturer's and/or engineer's specifications. Partially vaulted\n            storage tanks shall be allowed only where continuous electronic monitoring is used,\n            the depth to the water table from the base of the excavation is at least 50 feet above\n            the highest recorded water table depth and the permeability of the undisturbed soil\n            adjacent to the system is less than 10-3 centimeters per second. An example of this\n            system is shown in Figure 4-2 in Appendix V of this manual.\n            \n            Where one (1) primary container is installed in a storage facility, the secondary\n            containment must be sized to contain 110 percent of the volume of the primary container\n            placed in it. In making calculations to size the secondary containment, the portion\n            of the material that would remain in the primary container, in the event of a leak,\n            may be included in the 110 percent. However, the volume of the secondary containment\n            displaced by any backfill shall be taken into consideration in the calculations. Example\n            1 on page 22 should further illustrate how the proper sizing of the secondary containment\n            can be calculated.\n            \n            Where multiple primary containers are installed in an underground storage facility,\n            the secondary containment must be sized to contain 110 percent of the volume of the\n            largest container placed in it or 50 percent of the volume of all primary containers,\n            whichever is less. In making the calculations to size the secondary containment, the\n            portion of the material that would remain in the largest primary container, in the\n            event it leaked, may be included in the secondary containment volume. However, the\n            volume of the secondary containment displaced by the other tanks and the backfill\n            shall be taken into consideration in the calculations (see Example 2 on page 23).\n            \n            Where continuous electronic monitoring systems are installed in the secondary containment,\n            the volume displaced by the backfill need not be considered in calculating the required\n            secondary containment volumes.\n\n               A.\n\n               Double Walled Tank Storage System. (See Figure 4-2 in Appendix V of this manual for\n               detail)\n\n               Leak detection is normally achieved by one of two methods. The annular space can be\n               pressurized using an inert gas or liquid or it can be placed under a vacuum. Leaks\n               due to inner or outer wall failures can be detected by a loss of pressure or vacuum.\n               Product and water detecting probes or sensor cables may be installed in the annular\n               space to offer the other method of leak detection.\n\n               Continuous monitoring of the annular space is required.\n\n               Only double-walled tanks with a complete double shell will be approved as providing\n               adequate secondary containment.\n\n               B.\n\n               Fully Vaulted Storage System.

Chemical resistant coatings on interior surfaces and water barrier coatings\n               on exterior surfaces are required. The cover must be installed to provide completely\n               sealed waterproof joints at the walls. Depending on the design and traffic loading,\n               the final cover may be used as the trench cover if the structural integrity of the\n               system will not be affected by the traffic.\n\n               E.\n\n               Impermeable Liner Piping Containment System.

    "content": "The information in this section is intended to define the technical design criteria\n            needed for construction on parkland owned by the City of Austin.\n            \n            Although parkland construction is generally achieved through contractual agreement,\n            this section provides guidelines that coordinate the special requirements for park\n            construction with the general development requirements of the Land Development Code\n            and the Technical Manual Series.\n            \n            Appeals concerning the enforcement of these rules shall be brought to the Director\n            of the Parks and Recreation Department.\n            \n            Construction activities that disrupt the environment are an inevitable part of the\n            growth and maintenance of a city and as a city develops, the open areas of parks,\n            creeks and greenbelts become more attractive as routes for underground utilities.\n            This is the case in Austin where the many creeks and greenbelts, under the control\n            of the Parks and Recreation Department, have and will continue to provide a convenient\n            route. In many cases, such installation of underground utility lines, causes only\n            temporary disruption and the environment eventually returns by natural means to its\n            original state. The length of time required for recovery of the original vegetation\n            may be great, however, depending on the proximity of seed sources and the suitability\n            of soil conditions for plant establishment and growth. The purpose of these guidelines\n            is to reduce and control the construction impact upon the City's park areas and to\n            speed the recovery of natural vegetation. This can be done by minimizing the initial\n            environmental impact of construction, restoring suitable soil conditions and introducing\n            appropriate plant species.\n            \n            Construction impact can be minimized by selecting the least destructive route that\n            is feasible within the constraints of the budget. It also involves the avoidance of\n            unnecessary impacts during the course of construction, such as the excessive destruction\n            of vegetation and the loss of soil through uncontrolled erosion.\n            \n            Restoration of soils involves restoring the original contours of the land and ensuring\n            that soil physical conditions are suitable for plant growth. Soils of construction\n            sites have generally been compacted by heavy machinery and topsoil has been lost or\n            at least diluted by subsoils. These and other conditions must usually be improved\n            before vegetation can be established.",

    "subtitle": "ADVANTAGES OF RESTORATION AND REVEGETATION",
    "content": "Restoring natural vegetation in disturbed areas has practical advantages as well as\n            ecological and aesthetic ones. On the practical side, natural vegetation provides\n            low maintenance landscaping while also helping to minimize precipitation runoff and\n            the consequent problems of soil erosion, siltation and flooding. Ecological and aesthetic\n            advantages stem from the fact that natural vegetation is diverse in terms of species\n            composition and growth forms. This diversity results not only in a more interesting\n            landscape, but also one that provides suitable living space for native wildlife in\n            an increasingly urbanized area.\n            \n            A particular advantage of restoring natural vegetation in Austin is that of helping\n            to conserve the city's unique flora. These guidelines should be used in conjunction\n            with the Revegetation Criteria found in Section 1.4.0 of this manual.\n            \n            The objective of the revegetation criteria is to provide information on the processes\n            involved in planning the restoration of natural vegetation in disturbed areas.\n            \n            The procedures for route selection, reconnaissance survey and preconstruction inventory\n            should be followed. The information compiled should be presented as an environmental\n            report and used in conjunction with the Parks and Recreation Department in selecting\n            a route and for restoration and revegetation.\n            \n            The initial environmental impact of construction can be minimized by proper planning.\n            Effective and efficient restoration of the site upon completion of construction also\n            calls for planning.\n            \n            Ecologically or aesthetically valuable areas can often be avoided with little or no\n            increase in construction costs. The resulting environmental savings is doubled by\n            the fact that restoration of topography and vegetation is consequently less complex\n            and less expensive. Once a final project alignment is selected, further savings are\n            possible by planning resource salvaging efforts, erosion control and restoration of\n            topography and vegetation.",

    "content": "A reconnaissance survey is necessary in order to select the least expensive alignment\n            of the construction right-of-way corridor. Included in the expense estimate is the\n            cost of restoring the pre-existing vegetation following construction, as well as the\n            cost of the construction itself. In most cases, the cost of restoration will be insignificant\n            compared to the expense of moving the alignment to avoid vegetation, but not always.\n            If planning is done well in advance, it is probable that an alignment can be achieved\n            which will not be significantly more expensive, but will be considerably less destructive\n            than some other alignment that is made without reference to the vegetation.\n            \n            Using information obtained during the reconnaissance surveys, select the least destructive\n            route through the area. In comparing the costs of various alternatives, the costs\n            of restoration should be considered. For example, it may be less expensive to realign\n            a potential construction corridor to avoid important vegetational or topographic features\n            than to restore the features later. Rare plant populations must be avoided at all\n            costs. Transplanting the rare species elsewhere is no solution, since habitats suitable\n            for rare species are frequently protected.\n            \n            After the final alignment is selected, an inventory of the resources in and near the\n            construction easement should be conducted. This is necessary in order to plan restoration\n            efforts and to minimize the immediate environmental impact of the project.\n            \n            The simplest, most effective model for restoring vegetation is the original vegetation.\n            If this is described prior to construction there will be fewer decisions to make concerning\n            what species and densities to restore. If the original vegetation is weedy, however,\n            it would be advisable to restore a more desirable community.",

    "content": "Per Austin City Code, Chapter 10-6, smoking is prohibited in all City parks and any\n            other city-owned land used for a park or recreational purpose that is under the administrative\n            control of the Parks and Recreation Department. However, an exemption can be made\n            for temporary designated smoking areas in a park for special events.\n\n               1.\n\n               In order to have temporary designated smoking areas, an application must be submitted\n               through the Parks and Recreation Department's Office of Special Events. The department\n               director will then make a recommendation to City Council as to whether the exemption\n               should be granted, and City Council will have the final approval of granting an exemption\n               for temporary designated smoking areas.\n\n               2.\n\n               The application for temporary designated smoking areas must be submitted to the Office\n               of Special Events at the close out of the current calendar year for the upcoming year's\n               events, or at the time the Applicant submit their application for the special event\n               (whichever timeline is greater), but in no event no later than 8 weeks prior to the\n               event. If the deadline is missed, an appeal may be made to the Director. On appeal,\n               the director may waive the deadline provided that the applicant shows good cause that\n               the waiver should be granted. In order to show good cause, the applicant must show\n               at a minimum that failure to comply with the deadline was unintentional, that granting\n               the waiver will not unduly prejudice the City in any way, and that the applicant can\n               still comply with all other laws and legal requirements regulating the special event.\n               The Director may consider any other factor that the Director deems relevant to determining\n               the existence of good cause.\n\n               3.\n\n               Temporary designated smoking areas are permitted only during special events. Special\n               events are those events which are having or anticipating 1,000 or more persons and\n               must occur in approved special event venues. Special event sites include Auditorium\n               Shores, Brush Square Park, Fiesta Gardens West End, Republic Square Park, Walter E.\n               Long Park, Waterloo Park, Woolridge Square and other specially approved sites.\n\n               4.\n\n               The minimum physical requirements for a temporary designated smoking area include:\n\n               a.\n\n               The area must be at least 15-feet away from any heavily trafficked areas and areas\n               where people can congregate. Heavily trafficked areas include those areas where pedestrian\n               traffic is constantly flowing within the special event venue. Areas where people can\n               congregate include those areas where patrons (more than 3 people) gather within a\n               special event venue, such as food courts, audience-viewing stage area, vendor booths,\n               portable toilets' queue space, water stations, and other areas which attract gatherers.\n\n               b.\n\n               The area must be surrounded by a chain-link type fencing of preformed 6-feet-high\n               freestanding panels;\n\n               c.\n\n               The area must have at a minimum two entries/exits, and at least one uniformed security\n               officer shall be positioned at each entry/exit to check an age-bearing photo identification\n               of patrons entering the temporary designated smoking area;\n\n               d.\n\n               Fireproof receptacles for cigarette/cigar litter must be placed throughout the area;\n               throughout the duration of the event there should be no cigarette/cigar litter on\n               the park grounds, and the applicant is responsible for this ongoing cleanup;\n\n               e.\n\n               There should be no structures such as roofs or walls that would diminish the dispersion\n               and dilution of smoke; and\n\n               f.\n\n               Signs that read \"DESIGNATED SMOKING AREA\" must be placed in prominent locations throughout\n               the area. These signs must be at a minimum 10\u2033 Wide \u00d7 15\u2033 High in size.\n\n               5.\n\n               The temporary designated smoking areas shall be used by patrons for smoking purposes\n               only.\n\n               6.\n\n               Applicant's event staff should be aware of any temporary designated smoking areas\n               and how to direct smokers to them.\n\n               7.\n\n               At the conclusion of the special event, the temporary designated smoking areas will\n               be thoroughly cleaned and returned to its original state by the applicant.\n\n               8.\n\n               During periods when a Burn Ban is in effect exemptions for temporary designated smoking\n               areas are not granted. Refer to Austin City Code Chapter 8, Article 7, Restrictions\n               on Outdoor Burning. However, during a Burn Ban an Applicant may submit an application\n               for a temporary designated smoking area in the event that the Burn Ban ends prior\n               to the date of the event in which case a temporary designated smoking area would be\n               considered.\n\n               9.\n\n               The Applicant must fill out the Temporary Designated Smoking Area Application.",

Adequacy of\n            coverage should be determined by reference to published standards listing rates of\n            seeding for each species used. This mixture should contain a minimum of three (3)\n            different species of grass and five (5) different species of wildflowers.\n            \n            E.\n            \n            Native Species.\n            \n            All plant materials used must be native to the Austin area or adjacent areas of the\n            Edwards Plateau and should be installed in areas suitable for their growth. Native\n            species of shrubs, grasses and wildflowers are listed in the Texas Native Tree and Plant Directory, 1986, available at the Texas Department of Agriculture, Stephen F. Austin Building,\n            1700 Congress and in the revegetation criteria found in Section 1.5.0 of this manual.\n            \n            F.\n            \n            Revegetation Density.\n            \n            In order to determine density of revegetation which may be required on a specific\n            site, all sites located within the Hill Country Roadway Corridor will be classified\n            as to type and density of existing vegetative canopy coverage. This will be done through\n            use of air photos taken between 1982 and 1984. (Copies of these air photos are available\n            from the City of Austin, Watershed Protection and Development Review Department).\n            \n            1.\n            \n            The categories of existing vegetative cover are:\n            \n            \u2022\u2002High Density - (60-100 percent canopy coverage) - these sites will require restoration\n            according to the standard density ratio, noted above.\n            \n            \u2022\u2002Moderate Density - (30-59 percent canopy coverage) - these sites will require restoration\n            at \u00bd the standard density.\n            \n            \u2022\u2002Low Density - (zero (0) to 29 percent canopy coverage) - these sites will require\n            restoration at \u00bc the standard density.\n            \n            For areas where vegetation was cleared (prior to passage of the ordinance) for ranching\n            or farming and which has not been subsequently disturbed, seeding with the native\n            grass and wildflower mixture noted above will be the only restoration required.\n            \n            2.\n            \n            Installation and Maintenance.. For maximum survivability, planting of trees and shrubs\n            for restoration should occur only during the fall, winter and early spring (October\n            - April). (In general, most native grasses should be planted in late winter through\n            early spring; most wildflowers are best planted in early fall.) The work should be\n            done only under the supervision of someone skilled in landscape installation. Proper\n            maintenance of the materials after installation will be a key in whether the plants\n            survive. Prior to inspection, all trees and shrubs planted must be alive and in good\n            health; native grass and wildflower seeds must have been sown at adequate densities\n            and at the right time of year for each species.",

In the absence of human exposure data, Table\n            A-2 shall be used as a guideline.

The test procedures\n            as found in 29 CFR 1910.106 and 107 are mandatory liquids.\n            \n            EXTREMELY FLAMMABLE: Rating 4\n\n               Materials which on account of their physical form or environmental conditions can\n               form explosive mixtures with air and which are readily dispersed in air, such as dusts\n               of combustible solids and mists or flammable or combustible liquid droplets.\n\n            HIGHLY FLAMMABLE: Rating 3\n\n               Liquids and solids that can be ignited under almost all ambient temperature conditions.\n               This rating shall include:\n\n               Solid materials in the form of coarse dusts which may burn rapidly but which generally\n               do not form explosive atmospheres with air.\n\n               Solid materials in a fibrous or shredded form which may burn rapidly and create flash\n               fire hazards, such as cotton, sisal and hemp.\n\n               Materials which burn with extreme rapidity, usually by reason of self-contained oxygen\n               (e.g., dry nitrocellulose and many organic peroxides).\n\n               Materials which ignite spontaneously when exposed to air or to other substances.\n\n            MODERATELY COMBUSTIBLE: Rating 2\n\n               Materials that must be moderately heated or exposed to relatively high ambient temperatures\n               before ignition can occur. Materials with this rating would not under normal conditions\n               form hazardous atmospheres with air, but under high ambient temperatures or under\n               moderate heating may release vapor in sufficient quantities to produce hazardous atmospheres\n               with air. This rating shall include solids and semisolids which readily give off flammable\n               vapors.\n\n            SLIGHTLY COMBUSTIBLE: Rating 1\n\n               Materials that must be preheated before ignition can occur.\n\n               Materials with this rating require considerable preheating, under all ambient temperature\n               conditions, before ignition and combustion can occur. This rating shall include: Materials\n               which will burn in air when exposed to a temperature of 1,500 F (815 C) for a period\n               of five (5) minutes or less.\n\n            NONCOMBUSTIBLE: Rating 0\n\n               This group should include any material which will not burn in air when exposed to\n               a temperature of 1,500 F (815 C) for a period of five (5) minutes.\n\n               The relative ratings are taken from the NFPA 704M booklet, with changes in flash point\n               to reflect current IOTA regulations.\n\n            Table A-3RELATIVE FLAMMABILITY CRITERIA\n            \n            C.\n            \n            Determination of Degree of Reactivity.\n            \n            The reactivity hazard rating of a material shall be determined by evaluating the potential\n            for harm and the relative reactivity of the material or mixture of materials as a\n            whole, using the criteria which follow.\n            \n            Materials in this category may be self-reactive by polymerization, decomposition or\n            condensation and/or reactive with other materials commonly encountered in the work\n            place. The reactivity in this category often involves the rapid release of energy\n            in the form of heat and pressure and/or the release of highly hazardous products.\n            The assessment of relative reactivity requires specific knowledge of what materials\n            may be encountered in the work place.\n            \n            EXTREMELY REACTIVE: Rating 4\n\n               Materials which in themselves are readily capable of detonation or of explosive decomposition\n               or explosive reaction at normal temperatures and pressures. This rating should include\n               materials which are sensitive to mechanical or localized thermal shock at normal temperatures\n               and pressures.\n\n            HIGHLY REACTIVE: Rating 3\n\n               Materials which in themselves are capable of detonation or of explosive decomposition\n               or explosive reaction, but which require a strong initiating source or which must\n               be heated under confinement before initiation. This rating should include materials\n               which are sensitive to thermal or mechanical shock at elevated temperatures and pressures\n               or which react explosively with water without requiring heat or confinement.\n\n            MODERATELY REACTIVE: Rating 2\n\n               Materials which in themselves are normally unstable and readily undergo rapid chemical\n               change but do not detonate. This rating should include materials which can undergo\n               chemical change with rapid release of energy at normal temperatures and pressure.\n               It should also include those materials which may react violently with water or which\n               may form potentially explosive mixtures with water.\n\n            SLIGHTLY REACTIVE: Rating 1\n\n               Materials which in themselves are normally stable but which can become unstable at\n               elevated temperatures and pressures or which may react violently with water with some\n               release of energy but not violently.\n\n            NONREACTIVE: Rating 0\n\n               Materials which in themselves are normally stable, even under fire exposure conditions\n               and which are not reactive with water.",

    "subtitle": "INVENTORY AND RECONCILIATION RECORDS",
    "content": "Facilities must keep inventory records on file for each operating day and the operator\n            must review and reconcile these records at least once each month (weekly reconciliations\n            are highly recommended by the Department of Environmental Protection). The daily records\n            will consist of the Tank Inventory Record Log (the \"stickings\"), the Meter Record\n            Log and the Delivery Record Log (to be used when deliveries are made). The Inventory\n            review process will consist of balancing the actual inventory (based on gauge readings\n            or stickings), against the amount of product added to the tank (based on invoiced\n            quantities received) and the amount of product withdrawn from the tank (based on meter\n            readings). When metered dispensing systems are not used, inventory control records\n            will consist of taking level readings before and after each tank addition or withdrawal.\n            Examples of inventory record log sheets, a delivery record log sheet, and an inventory\n            review sheet are shown on the following pages. These samples are included only for\n            illustration purposes. If the forms you are presently using adequately cover the required\n            information, there will be no need to change forms.\n            \n            For facilities with metered dispensing equipment, daily beginning and ending level\n            readings, in gallons, using a dipstick, float gauge or other automatic liquid level\n            detecting device will be recorded along with daily beginning and ending meter readings.\n            This information shall be kept on an inventory report form to be supplied by each\n            facility. The format of the inventory forms is at the discretion of the owner/operator.\n            Samples of inventory report forms are given in API Publication 1621, Recommended Practice\n            for Bulk Liquid Stock Control at Retail Outlets and in More About Leaking Underground\n            Storage Tanks: A Background Booklet for the Chemical Advisory, published by the Environmental\n            Protection Agency . At least once a month the operator/owner must balance the tank\n            level readings against the meter readings and receipts. This inventory balance must\n            take into account any adjustments required due to additions or withdrawals of product\n            that did not go through the meter(s), any water or sludge removed from the bottom\n            of the tank, and any product dispensed for testing or repairs.\n            \n            Facilities without metered dispensing equipment will be required to record tank level\n            readings, in gallons, before and after each withdrawal from the tank. The number of\n            gallons dispensed is then subtracted from a running total which should reflect the\n            current inventory level in the tank at that point in time. When the tank is filled,\n            the total invoiced amount shall be added to this running total. If the amount of inventory\n            in the tank immediately before an addition or withdrawal is less than the amount shown\n            after the previous addition or withdrawal this may represent a loss of liquid in the\n            tank system. Allowances for water or sludge removed from the bottom of the tank must\n            also be taken into account.\n            \n            Inventory losses are to be reported immediately to the Department of Environmental\n            Protection under the following conditions:\n\n               A.\n\n               When gains or losses of over 0.1 percent of the dispensed quantities or 100 gallons,\n               whichever is more, are discovered in the reconciliation for any tank system during\n               any single monthly reconciliation period; or\n\n               B.\n\n               When cumulative gains or losses of over 0.5 percent of the dispensed quantities or\n               a total of over 300 gallons, whichever is less, are discovered in the reconciliations\n               for any tank system for any three (3) month period.\n\n            INVENTORY REVIEW SHEET INSTRUCTIONS.\n            \n            This information shall be recorded at least once each month, preferably at about the\n            same time in the month. The dipstick and meter readings must be taken simultaneously\n            while the dispensers are not in use. Fill in the columns on the sheet as indicated\n            below.\n\n               1.\n\n               The month.\n\n               2.\n\n               The month's opening dipstick inventory in gallons.

The maximum length of time between clearing and final revegetation of a project\n            shall not exceed 18 months, unless extended by the Director of the Watershed Protection\n            and Development Review Department (This does not affect the expiration of the site\n            plan or building permit. This requirement applies to sites that have suspended work\n            and are experiencing erosion control problems due to disturbed soil conditions.) Disturbed\n            areas must be maintained to prevent erosion and sediment loading of any waterways\n            or drainage facilities.\n            \n            3. It is a violation of the Code and this development permit to allow sediment from\n            a construction site to enter a classified waterway due to a failure to maintain the\n            required erosion and sedimentation controls or to follow the approved construction\n            sequence.",

    "content": "Section 25-8-27 of the Land Development Code (Redevelopment Exception in the Water\n            Supply Rural and Water Supply Suburban Watersheds) allows for redevelopment of existing\n            properties in the Water Supply Rural and Water Supply Suburban watersheds that do\n            not comply with current watershed regulations. This section cannot be applied to existing\n            residential development with two dwelling units or less per lot. In addition, this\n            section cannot be applied if unpermitted development occurred on the site after January\n            1, 1992. The owner can elect for a property to be governed by this section when a\n            site plan application is filed or if subdivision and site plan applications are filed\n            concurrently. Properties may redevelop under this section provided the following conditions\n            are met:\n\n               1.\n\n               The redevelopment may not increase the existing amount of impervious cover on the\n               site.\n\n               2.\n\n               The redevelopment may not further encroach into the Critical Water Quality Zone, the\n               Water Quality Transition Zone, or setbacks for Critical Environmental Features and\n               wetlands.\n\n               3.\n\n               The project must comply with Section 25-8-121 (Environmental Resource Inventory Requirement) and all construction phase environmental requirements (i.e. erosion and sedimentation\n               controls) in effect at the time of construction.\n\n               4.\n\n               The redevelopment site must provide a level of water quality treatment that is equal\n               to or greater than that which was previously provided. At a minimum, the site must\n               provide sedimentation/filtration ponds for the redeveloped area or an equivalent area\n               on the site.\n\n               5.\n\n               The property owner must provide mitigation land. The combined impervious cover of\n               the mitigation land and the portion of the redevelopment site treated by sedimentation/filtration\n               ponds may not exceed 20 percent of gross site area if in a water supply rural watershed\n               or 40 percent of gross site area if in a water supply suburban watershed.\n\n               6.\n\n               The redevelopment may not be located within the Erosion Hazard Zone unless protective\n               works are provided.\n\n            Project approval by a simple majority of the City Council is required if the redevelopment:\n\n               1.\n\n               Includes more than 25 additional dwelling units;\n\n               2.\n\n               Is located outside the City's zoning jurisdiction;\n\n               3.\n\n               Is proposed on property with an existing industrial use (as defined in LDC 25-2-5\n               Industrial Uses Described);\n\n               4.\n\n               Is inconsistent with a neighborhood plan; or\n\n               5.\n\n               Will generate more than 2,000 vehicle trips a day above the estimated traffic level\n               based on the most recent authorized use on the property.\n\n            The mitigation requirement may be satisfied by:\n\n               1.\n\n               Paying into the Water Supply Mitigation Fund (see Option 1 Worksheet);\n\n               2.\n\n               Transferring mitigation land to the City of Austin or placing restrictions on mitigation\n               land through a conservation easement (see Option 2 Worksheet); or\n\n               3.\n\n               A combination of these mitigation methods (see Option 1 and Option 2 Worksheets).\n\n            If the applicant chooses to provide mitigation land in lieu of paying into the Water\n            Supply Mitigation Fund, the person redeveloping shall pay all costs of restricting\n            the mitigation land or transferring the mitigation land to the City, including the\n            costs of:\n\n               1.\n\n               An environmental site assessment without any recommendations for further clean-up,\n               certified to the City not earlier than the 120th day before the closing date transferring\n               land to the City;\n\n               2.\n\n               A category 1(a) land title survey, certified to the City and the title company not\n               earlier than the 120th day before the closing date transferring land to the City;\n\n               3.\n\n               A title commitment with copies of all Schedule B and C documents, and an owner's title\n               policy;\n\n               4.\n\n               A fee simple deed, or, for a restriction, a restrictive covenant approved as to form\n               by the city attorney;\n\n               5.\n\n               Taxes prorated to the closing date;\n\n               6.\n\n               Recording fees; and\n\n               7.\n\n               Charges or fees collected by the title company.\n\n            The mitigation land provided by the applicant must be either greater than 100 acres\n            in size or directly adjacent to existing protected land. The mitigation land must\n            also have acceptable operating &amp; maintenance (O&amp;M) conditions, as approved by the\n            proposed land manager. The presence of an outstanding environmental feature or attribute\n            may allow the mitigation land to deviate slightly from the two previous criteria where\n            desirable and appropriate, pending approval from the Director of the Watershed Protection\n            Department. If the applicant is placing restrictions on the mitigation land, the conservation\n            easement must be approved and recorded prior to the issuance of a development permit.\n            \n            OPTION 1 WORKSHEETCALCULATION FOR PAYMENT INTO THE WATER SUPPLY MITIGATION FUND\n            \n            A.
