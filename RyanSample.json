A restoration plan must contain the following minimum components:\n\n               \u2022\u2002Soil Amendments\n\n               \u2022\u2002Native Species Seeding\n\n               \u2022\u2002Tree Seedling Planting\n\n               \u2022\u2002Exotic Invasive Species Control\n\n               \u2022\u2002Ragweed Management\n\n               \u2022\u2002Performance Criteria\n\n            During the course of inspections and field observations, adjustments to the Riparian\n            Restoration Plan may be required. The plan may be amended with the submission of additional\n            or amended parts of the plan and approval by the Watershed Protection Department.\n            \n            Riparian restoration will likely need additional time beyond the period of construction\n            to successfully elevate the function of the restored area to a good condition. Projects\n            which have not completed the riparian restoration process before the final environmental\n            inspection may enter into a Developer's Agreement for up to three years. The fiscal\n            posting amount for the Developer's Agreement shall be based on contractor estimates\n            of current cost for the materials and labor for installation and maintenance outlined\n            in the approved Riparian Restoration Plan. The estimates must be dated within 12 months\n            of the request for an agreement and must list suppliers who can provide the required\n            items. A certified estimate must be submitted to the City of Austin Environmental\n            Inspector by a landscape architect or professional engineer for review and acceptance\n            before a Developer's Agreement is written. The fiscal is returned only after a concurrence\n            letter for restoration is received and the final inspection is passed.\n            \n            B.\n            \n            Restoration Guidance\n            \n            The overall goal of the restoration should be to elevate the function of the restored\n            area from poor or fair condition to good. Restoration of floodplain function should\n            focus on a passive approach that promotes managed succession and a minimal need for\n            ongoing management. Restoration strategies and plant palettes will vary depending\n            on the zone (hydric vs. mesic), the ecoregion (Edwards Plateau vs. Blackland Prairie),\n            and the drainage area (minor vs. major waterways). Strategies should include simple,\n            straightforward techniques such as seeding, bare-root saplings, invasive removal,\n            and soil amendments rather than a more formal design involving containerized plants\n            and irrigation. Once completed, projects should demarcate restoration areas with signage\n            or boulders to prevent future clearing or mowing.\n            \n            C.\n            \n            Channel Design\n            \n            Where modification of the channel is permitted (e.g., necessary to protect public\n            health and safety, significant, demonstrable environmental benefit), design criteria,\n            calculation of flood flows and limiting velocities shall be in accordance with the\n            Drainage Criteria Manual. Innovative methods of design and construction which are\n            intended to emulate natural watercourses, promote channel stability, preserve existing\n            vegetation, preserve or improve in-stream aquatic habitat, and protect mature riparian\n            landscapes are encouraged, subject to approval by the Watershed Protection Department.\n            \n            Source: Rule No. R161-14.08, 3-5-2014.",

Restoration of floodplain function should\n            focus on a passive approach that promotes managed succession and a minimal need for\n            ongoing management. Restoration strategies and plant palettes will vary depending\n            on the zone (hydric vs. mesic), the ecoregion (Edwards Plateau vs. Blackland Prairie),\n            and the drainage area (minor vs. major waterways). Strategies should include simple,\n            straightforward techniques such as seeding, bare-root saplings, invasive removal,\n            and soil amendments rather than a more formal design involving containerized plants\n            and irrigation.",
